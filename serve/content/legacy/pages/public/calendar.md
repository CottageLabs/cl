<h1>Calendar 2016</h1>

<p>Oooh, you're keen!</p>

<p>This is where the Cottage Labs Calendar 2016 will be found - but not yet.</p>

<p>Each month we'll publish a new page which will contain a puzzle, an interesting story, some nice pictures, or maybe a combination of all three.  So, check back every month, or keep an eye on our <a href="http://twitter.com/cottagelabs">twitter</a> feed for a reminder.
