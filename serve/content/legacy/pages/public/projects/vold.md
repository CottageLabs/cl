**Project Summary**

In this first phase of research we analyzed the Cambridge Library Web Services (CLWS) software development project. The initial findings point to some significant differences in user engagement between local and outsourced development projects.

Through conversation with the development team potential outline metrics were identified and quantitative estimates provided to describe stakeholder engagement and timescales.

Initial estimates suggest the Cambridge Libraries Web Services development project achieved 100% stakeholder consultation and high user engagement rates of 29%, compared with less than 1% engagement for a comparable outsourced project.
