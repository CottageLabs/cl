**Project Summary**

This is an investigation into visualisations in HTML5, and how they can benefit the further and higher education community. The aim is to extract metadata embedded in HTML5 documents and use it to present information in a user friendly way, thus increasing accessibility and disseminability whilst maintaining interoperability.
