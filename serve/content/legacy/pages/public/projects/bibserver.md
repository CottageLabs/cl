**Project Summary**

This project involved taking some software originally developed by Jim Pitman at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of California Berkeley, and updating it to make it suitable for use in the ongoing Open Biblio projects.

This software is written in python, and now also relies on Elastic Search, which is based on Java and the Apache Lucene project. The developed software package is open source and available for free use from our repository.
