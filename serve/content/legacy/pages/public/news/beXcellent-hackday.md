<h1>BeXcellent</h1>
</div>

<p>Cottage Labs first became involved with <a href="http://www.childreninscotland.org.uk/">Children in Scotland's</a> <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/bexcellent">BeXcellent</a> project during <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/bex">Bex's</a> previous life in the graphic design industry, when we teamed up with her agency on some <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/curriculum-for-excellence">web development work</a>. The aim of the project is to build a website that will help children and young people engage with the <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/"> Curriculum for Excellence</a>, the new curriculum being implemented in Scotland. The project came about when the Scottish Government and CIS identified that most of the information about CfE is aimed at adults such as parents and teachers, with little catering for the needs of the children and young people it will most affect.</p>

<h2>Action Day</h2>
<p>The start of the New Year saw the project move into its second phase with an action day which Bex attended as a mentor - bringing children and young people together with people from the film, writing and of course, software development industries to gather ideas and help make BeXcellent into the website the children and young people want for themselves, as well as putting Curriculum for Excellence into action by working and learning together. </p>

<p>Following a short presentation from the mentors, we split into small groups with the children and young people choosing the area that most interested them. Bex's IT and design group came up with some brilliant ideas for customising the look and feel (we <3 bubbles!) to make the site simpler, more social and more content-led. </p>

<p>The action day offered the chance to work with some truly inspirational and talented young people, whose coding and design skills are impressive! </p>

<h2>BeXcellent Hackday</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks ago,  Mark and Bex spent the day at CIS offices in Edinburgh helping the IT and Design group learn more about the process of building a website and put their programming and design skills to good use. First we worked out a set of user stories; who might use the BeXcellent site? What for? Why?  Then the group split into teams and set to work designing and building something that would meet the needs of those users. In just a few hours, the children and young people had sketched, artworked and built a homepage, written up a first blog post and created a mascot for the project! </p>

<p>We're really happy to be involved in such an exciting project and are looking forward to the next action day at the beginning of March. </p>
