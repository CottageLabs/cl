<h2>Gaufres, beer and Getting our Geek on!</h2>
<p>February got off to a brilliant start for us at Cottage Labs as we spent the first weekend of the month in the awesome city of Brussels attending <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/"> FOSDEM 2013!</a> The annual conference brings together more than 5000 developers (this year there was 7000!) from  free and open source communities across Europe for lightning talks, lectures and the chance to get together and share ideas. This year featured some really interesting talks; our 'Comms team' <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/bex">Bex</a> and <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/richard">Richard</a> attended some useful lectures as part of the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/community_development_and_marketing/">Community Development and Marketing</a> devroom, which, although not necessarily teaching us anything brand new, we found helpful as an insight into how the FOSS community as a whole approaches marketing and communications. It was also great to hear <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/qandasocial/">a talk </a> on Graph Processing which was hosted by some of our partners on the <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/opencitations"> OpenCitations</a> project.</p>

<h2>A day in the life of a FOSDEM volunteer</h2>
<p>While most of the Lab went to the conference to attend some talks and meet people, our associate <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/emanuil" >Emanuil</a> and his partner Nevelina went one step further, volunteering to be conference staff for the weekend.  Here, they give their account of an exhausting but brilliant experience:</p>
<br>
<p>Volunteering at FOSDEM is a truly unique experience. It is rare to meet people so passionate about what they are doing and about their cause that they spare no effort. The conference ended up attracting around 7000 people (kudos to the guys who thought of how to estimate this via network usage stats!) and all in all there were less than 100 people organising it, both staff and volunteers. It was a truly marvellous example of what people can do when they set their mind to it, especially at tear-down where people who had helped all through the day stayed late to take everything down; signs, cables, balloons, tables. Everything. And then mop it all so that no trace (well, almost, we did forget the huge FOSDEM sign) was left. This conference is built on goodwill, and it definitely shows that when people want something to go well, it goes well. Staff were multitasking machines and visitors were absolutely brilliant at understanding, being patient and genuinely wanting to make sure everybody has a good time. When you volunteer at FOSDEM you get people thanking you more often than you'd think. Some volunteering duties include manning the infodesk; taking donations, giving goodies, giving directions; moderating talks, recording videos of the talks and managing cloakroom. There are more, really, there is always more with events like this. Should you wish to volunteer in the coming years, I can guarantee you will have the experience of a lifetime!</p>

<h2>Herge's adventures of.....Misti and Guy!</h2>
<p> Of course, in addition to all the serious conferencing, the weekend consisted of a lot of exploring (largely made possible by <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/martyn">Martyn</a> and his amazing organisational/beer recommendation skills!) and sampling the delicious belgian food (waffles!!), chocolat chaud and beer. Misti and Guy (<a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/mark">Mark</a> and Bex's wife and husband respectively!) took the time while we were getting our geek on to do some serious sightseeing (including a tour organised by the <a href=""https://fosdem.org/2013/">FOSDEM</a> staff). Below, Misti gives us the lowdown on this amazing city:</p>
<br>
<p>The best word to describe Brussels as a city is 'eclectic'. No two buildings are exactly alike. In fact, except in the perfectly symmetrical Koningsplein laid out in the 18th century, neighbouring buildings are often as unlike each other as it is possible to be while occupying roughly identical narrow spaces on the picturesque cobbled streets. The growth and history of the city is impossible to determine at a glance, having been mixed up by greatly differing populations throughout the years. In particular, very little medieval architecture was left unmarred by the romantics while they held sway in the 18th century. Not a single piece of medieval stonework escaped embellishment by statues, scrolls and scripture save some still free standing pieces of the city wall. This eccentricity makes walking in Brussels a joy, with grand buildings, secret gardens and fantastic street art to discover at every turn. The centre is very much set up for tourists, but that doesn't impair it as much as you might think, unless you were of a mind to buy something besides chocolate, lace, antiques or african art. If, when you find yourself trapped between competing tour groups you disagree, bear in mind that, with more than 50% of the population of the city being non-belgian in origin, this mad cacophony of people and languages is the real Brussels. As far as food goes, we did very well anywhere with 'Taverne' in the name and avoided anywhere with a tout outside. In particular, <a href="http://www.taverne-brouette.be/en/welcome/">La Brouette Taverne</a> on the Grande Place offered a warm welcome and good, unfussy food. Slightly more modern and well worth a visit is the <a href="http://www.comicscafe.be/english/overview/">Comics Cafe</a> at Grand Sablon which serves a range of exciting burgers and tasty not-to-sweet milkshakes. To celebrate a birthday we went to <a href="www.taverne-du-passage.be/fr/bienvenue/">Taverne du Passage</a> in the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert where the food was excellent but the service less so. Of course, no matter where you go, everything in Brussels is served with
âfritesâ. If you need help choosing the moules frites are of course very good, but as an alternative I highly recommend the fish Waterzooi (a creamy stew) which appears on a lot of 'local' menus. Also to be sampled is the Belgian Pain Greque, a pastry modelled after a stale bread and sugar confection given by monks to the poor. As far as chocolates go, Pierre Marcolini is the recognised king and well worthy of the title. His cakes, too, are wonderful and the prices are not as
steep as you might expect. Even with an informative scheduled walking tour (thank you FOSDEM!) and a couple of museum trips (<a href="http://www.comicscenter.net/en/home">the Belgian Comic Strip Centre</a> and the <a href="http://www.mucc.be/"> Museum of Cocoa and Chocolate</a>) I found two and a half days to be ample time to explore the city on foot so if you are ever expecting to stay for any length of time in Belgium I suggest planning day trips to the
surrounding area. For ourselves, we followed the footsteps of Colin Farrell's morose hitman to Bruges, a very pretty town about an hour away from Brussels by train. While charming to walk around, it was a bit of a shame that the canal boat tours don't run in winter.</p>
