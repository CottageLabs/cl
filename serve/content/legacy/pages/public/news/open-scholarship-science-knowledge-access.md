What is Open Scholarship? This might be immediately obvious to a member of the Higher Education software development community, or an academic of some experience. However, it is not as obvious to a newcomer to HE, much like the idea of Free Software to somebody who is not a computer scientist.

As I was recently introduced to the HE software dev. community, I want to try to provide some insight into what goes through the mind of a newcomer. What went through my mind as I was trying to understand the subject?

<h2>A newbie</h2>

First, a small bit about me and how I came to know about Open Scholarship. I'm on an industrial year placement right now, working with PHP + Oracle tools for Aberystwyth University, same place which may grace me with a BSc in 2013. In the middle of November 2011, I went to an event called <a href="#devxs-footnote">DevXS</a>, because it sounded fun and I really wanted to take a step towards becoming a solid software developer. (Which seems rather hard while you're still doing your degree!)

Mark and Richard from <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/">Cottage Labs</a> were there and had an idea. I started working on <a href="http://idfind.cottagelabs.com/">IDFind</a> with them and had loads of fun learning Python and <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">elasticsearch</a> - really a joy to work with! This is also when I was introduced to the idea of Open Knowledge and got to know about the <a href="http://www.okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, as well as a bit about Open Scholarship.

<h2>First impressions</h2>

After DevXS in November 2011, Open Scholarship was:

<ol>
    <li>Open: publicly available for free</li>
    <li>Linked data (e.g. data.gov.uk ) - for science</li>
    <li>"Stuff" to make open - mainly research:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Papers</li>
    <li>More research - data, metadata, comments about how the data was processed</li>
    <li>Code - part of main research output</li>
    <li>Helper code - bespoke tools used to analyse the data</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

This was <em>really</em> important, like, "Free Software"-important, or just "Freedom"-important. It would have the power to change the intrinsic core of how science works.

Also, the current closed publishing industry was causing stagnation in science itself. This was bad. Apparently, these folks got richer by denying access to publicly-funded research (which was created and reviewed for free as far as they were concerned). Mmh.

<h2>Open Scholarship revisited</h2>

In February 2012, I went to the <a href="#dev8d-footnote">Dev8D</a> event (there's a pattern here...). Quite a lot of learning ensued, including:

<ol>
    <li>Open Scholarship is not the same as Open Knowledge.
It makes sense if you think about it. Open Scholarship produces Open Knowledge. It's the whole scholarly method/process. Open Knowledge is freely accessible and reusable information.</li>
    <li>It's not just linked data for science, that's a bit ridiculous. However, there is some Open Knowledge which is linked data, and this concept does help people see the benefits of opening up their research and other information.</li>
    <li>Open is not just "accessible for no price", it needs to be suitably licensed for reuse, as well as accessible in a variety of formats, including machine-readable (arguably more important, since you can technically construct an interface to access data, but scraping an interface to construct data is ... flaky, at best).</li>
    <li>Openness leads to better scholarship. Scholars can learn from one another, not just about their research, but also about their methods, how they go about doing research and writing papers and so on. I do think it would actually improve the quality of scholarly output, e.g. by making truly "global" scholarship easier, but I can't pass judgement.</li>
    <li>Note I've used the phrase Open Scholarship instead of Open Science. It's not just for STEM subjects. I don't know if this might actually turn many arts and humanities people off, but I wouldn't want to risk even scholar, it's not worth it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Open Scholarship convert</h2>

It matters. That's all there's to it. I'd love to take a more active part in the general Free Software movement as a developer as well, it's what got me into Computer Science and it's part of what makes the field worth the effort. I can definitely see why people are passionate about this, it embodies ideals I have admired for a long time. Hopefully I'll contribute something meaningful (I suppose that's what all of us mainly want, at the very least everybody in the Education sector).

<h2>Interesting events</h2>

<div id="devxs-footnote">

<h3>DevXS</h3>

<a href="http://devxs.org/">DevXS</a> is a (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>-{<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/">UKOLN</a>-[<a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/">DevCSI</a>-]})funded development marathon (c.a. 24 hours on a weekend), aimed mainly at Undergraduate students, which introduces concepts like linked data, invites learning about mobile app. development and tries to introduce the joy of hackathons.

</div>
<div id="dev8d-footnote">
<h3>Dev8D</h3>

<a href="http://dev8d.org/">Dev8D</a> is another <a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/">DevCSI</a>-funded event. It's a conference aimed at developers and generally professionals working in Higher Education. The 8D is the "happy geek" emoticon.

<p><em>The slides associated with his presentation at Dev8D can be found <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/open-stuff-beginner-pov-emanuil.pdf">here</a></em></p>

<p><em>This was a guest post by Emanuil Tolev, winner of Best Newcomer at Dev8D.  Emanuil is an undergraduate
student of Computer Science. He's doing this degree for two reasons:
the philosophy presented in the Free Software movement, and the
interesting problems that needed solving. Coupled with a curiosity
about what makes a good teacher, this led to thoughts about working in
Higher Education and he started off by working for 1 year as a
software developer for his place of study, Aberystwyth University.
Another stroke of curiosity led him to the <a href="http://devxs.org/">DevXS</a> and <a href="http://dev8d.org/">Dev8D</a> events, where he got to know
Cottage Labs and work on <a href="http://idfind.cottagelabs.com/">IDFind</a>. Deciding that Python
and <a href="http://elasticsearch.org/">elasticsearch</a> were cooler for
some things than PHP and Oracle, he now gets to cherish the time spent
on open source projects for the HE community.</em></p>
