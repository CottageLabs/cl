#Mobile Futures 

Cottage Labs is working with JISC to [produce a report on the future of mobile technology in Higher Education.](/projects/mobilefutures) Aimed at high-level senior managers within Higher Education Institutions, the report will explore the way in which mobile technology is changing the landscape in which they operate, via a series of thematic examples across areas including strategy, student experience and efficiency. 

We recently met with Ben Showers in London to discuss the plan for the report; here we take you through some of the ideas covered in our discussion:

##What do we mean by mobile? 

The word 'mobile' is increasingly becoming something of a buzzword; in order to avoid being caught up in this in our report, it is important that we clarify what we mean when we use this term. When we talk about the "mobile future," we are referring to a world in which the ability to access and process data is virtually universal - where the devices we need in order to perform such tasks are essentially so ubiquitous as to be disposable - like paper is today. So we are interested in how a sector that provides education - which is essentially tailored and managed access to high quality curated information - can achieve its goals in that sort of future, fulfil a critical goal in such a future infrastructure, and do so efficiently (and therefore at better cost).

##Report structure

The report will include an executive summary (possibly as an infographic) as its opening section, which will provide an overview of the mobile landscape both within and outwith UK Higher Education. The second section will introduce the themes we will be looking at in the report, which will include areas of specific interest to senior managers such as strategy, student experience (both learning and integration into the university community), and efficiency (in particular how content can be distributed to a much wider audience.) We have been busy researching a series of internal and external case studies which will be 'tagged' or coloured with the themes they represent and pulled together to form the third section of the report. The collegiate structure of HEIs means that while they might be at the leading edge of technological advancement in one department (research, for example), they often do not take advantage of their own outputs across the institution. The fourth section of our report will attempt to build on the evidence from the case studies to illustrate how the sector could implement the benefits of its own research, and will propose a collaborative approach across the sector to understand the potential benefits and work towards a commitment to the mobile future. The infographic from Section 1 will be supported by an appendix, in which we will list all of the exciting examples of mobile technology that we have found but may not have been able to go into in the main report. 

We also discussed the possibility of including an addendum to the report in which we discuss what JISC could do to help across the sector, for example, how could the organisation ensure that some of the exciting advances in mobile technology being produced in HEIs are more widely shared and utilised? One possible solution could be to pull people together across various institutions for a discussion on how to visualise and realise the mobile future. 

##Dissemination

We will be producing a series of blog posts as we work on this report, which will include progress updates such as this one as well as discussions outlining some of the interesting discoveries we are making over the course of our research. We will also generate interest in this report by sharing with people within JISC as well as our team of Beta readers. Further exposure may be achieved with a community event such as the UCISA conference, however this would have to form part of a wider push by JISC to ensure the report reaches as many people as possible. 

##Timeline

Work will continue on the research for this report over December/January with a view to presenting to the Beta readers in mid-February. Feedback from the Beta readers will be integrated and the final report ready for presentation to JISC for publishing by mid-March.
