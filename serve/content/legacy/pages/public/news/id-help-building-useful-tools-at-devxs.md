this weekend Richard and I have been at <http://devxs.org>, and we have been working on a team challenge based on an idea I had a couple of weeks ago along with some other people - build a service that helps to identify identifiers.

Our example is up here: <http://idhelp.cottagelabs.com>

It works so far on DOIs. Submit one, it will tell you about it!

More to come very soon, we will get this up as a proper service.

Our dev notes are here:

( so we can remember them)
