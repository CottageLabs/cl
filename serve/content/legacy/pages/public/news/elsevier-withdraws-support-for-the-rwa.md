#Elsevier withdraws support for the RWA
<br>

Good news for OA today in the announcement that publishing giant Elsevier is withdrawing its support for the controversial Research Works Act in the US.  The proposed legistlation is aimed at tightening publishers control over academic content.

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act">wikipedia</a>:

<em>"The <strong>Research Works Act</strong>, also known as H.R. 3699, is a bill that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives ... on December 16, 2011... The bill contains provisions to prohibit open access mandates for federally funded research and effectively revert the NIH's Public Access Policy that requires taxpayer-funded research to be freely accessible online. If enacted, it would also severely restrict the sharing of scientific data."</em>

The fact that Elsevier has reconsidered is a hugely positive for OA publishing  and shows the strength of popular dissent. A number of campaigns recently have garnered vocal support from the academic community and the next step now is surely to capitalize on this support to ensure that people go on to use the tools available and build the next stages of infrastructure to better disseminate knowledge.

An interesting point was made in <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/02/27/the-missing-outcry-are-the-nih-and-its-researchers-shirking-their-obligations/">another article</a> today regarding the actual uptake of OA within the community:

<em>"Of 738 trials that were interventional (that is, patients were put at risk) and which required [OA] reporting within 12 months, only 22% had reported results. A full 78% had not...."</em>

<em></em><em>"researchers should keep their promises to the taxpayers funding their research by actually sharing the data, writing up the reports required of them, and depositing both with their funding agencies when the terms of their funding require such actions."</em>
