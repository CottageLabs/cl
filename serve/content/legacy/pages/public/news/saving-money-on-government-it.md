I spotted this article on the BBC website earlier today:

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12905303](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12905303)

At first it was uplifting that there seemed to be discussions of moves away from "big sexy IT" projects to smaller, sensible, well managed, better specced projects - but the article then goes on to describe how future projects will be limited to Â£100million - a slightly different concept of "smaller" than I had in mind. Whilst it would be good to see more of these projects made available to smaller businesses, if the concept of "small project" is "under Â£100million", there is still a bit of a barrier to entry.

Coupled with the further comments that 90% of public servants use Microsoft products on the unjustified basis that it will not be "hacked" - one presumes in comparison with some mythical open source software that is worse than MS offerings, and that an alternative might be to buy Apple products "because he uses them at home", leaves me with a concern that those in charge of buying public sector IT may realise that they have to appear to save money to look good these days, but still have absolutely no idea of the advantages of open source software - or indeed modern software development practices whatsoever.

Perhaps they would be surprised to learn that virtually all the critical systems on which we rely are in fact open source, and that the closed source systems are only sold to those that can either afford to (or have other good reason to) black box the issues (not the case for the public sector) or that are ignorant to the fact that they are being charged a fortune for nothing...
