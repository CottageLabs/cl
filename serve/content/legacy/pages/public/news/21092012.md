<p>This has been a very exciting week as we have been in the beautiful city of Helsinki, Finland at the world's first <a href="http://okfestival.org">Open Knowledge Festival</a></p>

<p>As well as meeting lots of cool, like-minded people, we have been participating in some really interesting events around the Festival's key theme, 'Open Knowledge in Action'.</p>

<p>Mark was part of a panel discussion on <a href="http://okfestival.org/openaccessinpractice">Open Access in Practice</a> along with representatives from the <a href="http://okfn.org/)">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>  Open Science and Open Access working groups, which provided insight into how open access is currently making a difference to the availability of academic and medical research papers and the work that still needs to be done in this area. As a result he is now totally famous and even got recognised in a restaurant by some other OKFest participants :P</p>

<p>We were involved in some awesome hackathons in which some really interesting work was produced (not to mention the amazing workspace at Helsinki's <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/about/contact/artdesign/">Aalto University</a>!) and had fun contributing to an Open Data Handbook which is being created by the guys from the Open Science topic stream.</p> 

<p>The highlight of the Festival for all of us was getting to see a lecture by the AMAZING <a href="http://www.gapminder.org">Hans Rosling</a> on how access to facts ensures we can really know what's going on in the world and make decisions on how to change it. A truly inspirational talk with some brilliant data visualisations! </p>

<p>We'll be back to reality next week - bring on OKFest 2013!</p>
