<p>At the start of the year <a href="/people/richard">Richard</a> published a paper in <a href="http://www.dlib.org/">D-Lib</a> with colleagues Stuart Lewis (University of Edinburgh) and Pablo de Castro (SONEX).  From the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
The SWORD (Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) protocol was designed to facilitate the interoperable deposit of resources into systems such as repositories. The use of an interoperable standard eases the burden of developing clients to deposit such resources. This paper examines nine different deposit use cases, and provides case studies and examples of each use case to demonstrate the wide range of repository deposit scenarios. The use cases range from the deposit of scholarly communication outputs from a publisher to a repository and the automatic deposit of data from laboratory equipment, to inter-repository transfer and collaborative authoring workflows.
