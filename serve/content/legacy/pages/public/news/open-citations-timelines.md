<p>We have now added some timeline demonstrations to our Open Citations Corpus data. From within the previously-demo'ed graphview, a timeline can be requested of the current resultset, showing articles by publication date.</p>

<p>The timeline demonstration is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://occ.cottagelabs.com/timeline">http://occ.cottagelabs.com/timeline</a>. However, a better approach may be to go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://occ.cottagelabs.com/graphview">graphview</a> and make some selections; from three, trigger a timeline via the button.</p>

<p>We currently have line, bar and area charts available, with options to view grouped (bars), stacked (bars), streamed or expanded (area). Some of these options are not useful as yet because we are currently only laying one dataset to the graph at a time.</p>

<p>However from this we can go on to generate some comparisons, such as "which author published more during a given time period, and at what points?". Although at present the timeline only presents one result set, adding this overlay feature will be the next feature to be added.</p>
