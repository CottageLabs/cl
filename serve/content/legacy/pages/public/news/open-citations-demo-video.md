<p>Here we have a video showing the three prototype apps we have made for the Jisc Open Citations Corpus project. Each prototype demonstrates a part of the functionality required to answer a range of questions that the typical researcher may need answered. Each app handles a particular type of question particularly well, and the aim in the next phase of work would be to combine the functionality of the three across one useful website where such queries could be made, answers saved, and reports generated.</p>

<h3>The facetview</h3>

<p>Built during the Jisc Open Bibliography project, we have re-purposed the facetview javascript app to present a faceted browse text search across the Open Citations Corpus. With this, it is easy to search for particular strings, phrases, or terms, and view ordered list results of relevant articles.</p>

<p>As our demonstration video shows, this enables us to do things like search for the string "shotton", then narrow down to the author "Shotton, David", then narrow further to publications by said author within a given journal or to organise the results by year. It is possible to view and save a link to the particular search result set, so that it can be bookmarked to return to later, or shared with others, or used in further queries within the other apps or for reporting at a later stage.</p>

<h3>The graphview</h3>

<p>Building on the initial graphview prototype started by Mark for some of his own PhD work, a force-directed network graph is used to display what the facetview cannot display so well - namely relations between things. We can, for example, narrow down the visualised articles by journal, author or citation, and then map the relations between the relevant articles by seeing how they connect together via one or multiples of the same relations - journals, authors, or citations.</p>

<p>With this we can, for example, visualise every article that cites a particular article DOI or PMID and see how they link together. Further visualisation allows for comparison of authors across the articles that cite said identifier.</p>

<h3>The timeline</h3>

<p>Finally, we have the timeline - a straightforward approach to building a visual report based on queries gained from the previous apps (although currently only minimally wired in). With the timeline we can choose to view the articles presented in a given query result across a given time span, as either bar, line or area charts.</p>

<p>At present there is only the capability to generate one result set on the charts at one time, but the underlying functionality to generate multiple result sets is already in place; further work to connect the facetview, graphview and timeline together will make use of this to allow overlays of differing result sets for comparison purposes, so that questions such as "which journal published more papers on graphene per month between dates X and Y" can be easily compared.</p>
