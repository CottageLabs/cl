We are pleased to launch a new report on behalf of JISC that will examine the advantages of APIs in the context of the UK HE sector.

This report will take in technical aspects of implementation as well as providing a perspective on the business advantages and cost implications of using APIs to share and access data.

In preparing this broad ranging report we are seeking to engagewith the Higher Education community  as widely as possible and will be posting to this blog with updates. If you have any comments, input or expereince  in this area and would like to contribute please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>.
