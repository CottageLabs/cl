We are happy to say today that we have now started work on our XCRI-CAP course feeds demonstrator project for JISC.

Over the course of this project, which runs until March 2013, we will be looking for interesting ways to extract data about university courses via the newly set up XCRi-CAP feeds. Our aim is to demonstrate that these feeds provide valuable information that can be used to better present the higher education community to the rest of the world, and to enable imrpoved access to and sharing of course information.

This project involves [Mark](/people/mark) and [Richard](/people/richard), and the project page is at <http://cottagelabs.com/projects/xcri>. Regular posts will be put up during the project, under the <strong>xcri</strong> tag.
