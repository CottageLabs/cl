Continuing the presentation of my Studies in Open Scholarship work for Open Access Week 2013, the second topic is <b>collaborative vs competitive education and research</b>.

Without a doubt, some people are competitive - and as most people can be involved in education or research of some sort, it is not surprising that competition plays a part in education and research. There are also limited funds and limited positions, and there are people with differing capabilities vying for access to those funds and positions, so competition is not only unsurprising - it is often a requirement.

However, this does not mean that competition is a requirement of either education or of research; it does not mean that scholarship requires competition.

All of the scholarly artefacts of which we are aware do rely on some sort of collaboration. There has never been a scholar who has completed a piece of research or successfully educated a student who has not collaborated in some form. At most there may have been a scholar who completed a great work without reference to or conversation with any other scholar, and without communicating their findings in any way whatsoever; this work must be one solely contemplative in nature, and it is not one about which we, the scholarly community, could ever have been or will ever become aware. The work of the lone scholar is a closed world, having no interactions with our scholarly world, having no basis for comparison or competition. It is therefore beyond the scope of discussion regarding the concepts of collaboration and competition.

In light of this, it is necessary only to consider known works in the collaboration vs competition debate. But all known works are ones about which we have become aware, and all (remaining) unknown works are ones about which we will become aware. This is the point at which the debate takes precedence.

As becoming aware requires in itself a form of collaboration, it is not possible to remove collaboration from education and research; collaboration is therefore a fundamental tenet of scholarship. Any scholarly community may additionally partake in competitive practices, for reasons such as resource management, or egoism, et cetera. However none of those reasons can be considered a necessity of scholarship, but rather a choice of community practice.

Should competition be permitted to become the overriding factor of a scholarly community to the extent that said community ceases to interact and becomes essentially hermetic, it would also cease to compete. Only at the point at which advances are released back into the wider world can they be compared and found to be competitively fit or weak; thus, competition in fact remains tempered at all times by collaboration. In the extreme case, a sufficiently great competitive advantage may result in collaboration causing the demise or assimilation of some other community - potentially, of all of the rest of the wider community - the case for war, for example, and some forms of business, and of the death of communities that uphold traditional doctrines despite their supercedence. 

Scholarship <b>is</b> collaboration.

By debating the extent to which we maintain our community with competitive practices, we do not affect the state of scholarship; we make a choice as to how far removed from the default state we are willing to allow our scholarly society to become.

If you want to contribute to this statement, please take part in my survey; it is available now, or if you would like more information first, wait until the end of OA week for my complete series of topical posts.
