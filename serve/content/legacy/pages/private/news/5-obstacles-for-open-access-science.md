5 Reasons open access is not universal

	* Ignorance - people just don't know there is an alternative. In a lot of cases staff have heard about OA but don't understand what it means. Existing business processes are based around a traditional publishing model and this creates a certain inertia resistant to change. 
	* 
	* Apathy- People know but they don't care. In many cases people involved with academic publishing are aware of OA and the benefits it can bring but they are not sufficiently motivated to pursue it. People may be aware that large amounts of money are wasted, that could be better used for research, but its not their money so they are insuficently interested. It is easier to continue as things are at the moment than to enact any change.
	* 
	* Elitism- Within certain sections of the academic community there is a conception of elitism that drives negative outcomes.  While the idea of an elite, that is a group of the best in a field, can be positive it also drives closed social groups and cliques. An institutional concept of elitism can reinforce exisitng models where a sense of validation or superiority is derived purely from the fact that an academic work is complex. The idea, at both the personal and institutional level, that academic articles are far too complex for the average person to understand is reinforced by the concept of publishing based around elite institutions and journals.
	* 
	* Secrecy - The current funding environment means that academics compete for funding based on their published work. Some research, based on a single idea, may take several years to fully realise and funding is tied to a regular quarterly publishing cycle.   The number of actionable ideas an individual can come up with is limited by time and if there is the potential for other groups elsewhere in the globe to move faster and take away funding there can be reluctance  to share data.  As such some individuals are reticent to share too much, too widely or too soon.  While this has less effect on the OA publishing of articles it is an impediment to OA data sharing and while the funding system is tied implicitly to published research it again reinforces the existing system.
	* 
	* Age bias- the majority of academics produce their best work in their twenties <a href="#cmnt_ref1" name="cmnt1">[1]</a>.  Older more senior academics will typically have more political clout within their organisations but produce less creative work. It is therefore easier and preferable for older, more senior individuals  to publish in 'high impact' journals that recognize reputation than to compete on  metric based systems that look  at article level citations, impact etc. As funding is intiricatly tied into the traditional publishing model as well as the politics of an institution there is again resistance to change. Any system that provides funding based on article productivity or creative quality will tend to discriminate against older individuals.This can equate to a strong institutional bias towards respected journals.

To date a lot has been done to tackle points 1 and 2 but very little has been done as regards the remaining points. It can be argued that these represent a more difficult issue and in some cases form part of the core institutional culture. To create a new system of academic dissemination without tackling these cultural issues will simply result in the same themes expressing themselves in a different way. As a result there is a strong need for cultural change to go along with technological efforts to provide OA. Both the funding and publishing landscapes need to incentivse sharing if they are to see changes towards OA.
