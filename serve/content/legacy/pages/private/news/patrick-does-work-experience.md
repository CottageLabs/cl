<h1>Work experience <br>with Cottage Labs!</h1>
</div>

This week we have Patrick, a student at [St. Maurice's High School](http://www.st-maurices.n-lanark.sch.uk/), doing work experience with us. So we're going to write about his progress here!

How exciting :)

Patrick says: I can hardly wait! Hi Everyone!

Hello everyone! My plan over the week is going to be to work on the BeXcellent site, making a few fixes/improvements and to start working on a project based on Portality: a music application to rival spotify (haha).

It will be a music streaming site that will basically make my library available to access anywhere. My plan is to store the file locations in elasticsearch, and then to write a script that sends them as html audio tags.  Does anyone have any suggestions or better ways to do it than this?

BeXcellent Work: www.github.com/BeXcellent/Bexcellent-2/issues


So we started at 1000 or so on Monday morning, meeting up at Haymarket train station. Now we're planning some activities.


MONDAY
	* look over bexcellent project and create a milestone for Friday
	* identify a set of issues that could be completed by then
	* meet with Steve and Mark at 1130ish
	* hear from Steve about his use of the http://github.com/CottageLabs/portality default repo on ssh-attacks
		- JSON Viewer 0.7.1, Postman - REST Client 0.8.4.10 (useful chrome estensions for ElasticSearch)
	* read about what markdown is http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/   - done, I think I get it  (no you don't Patrick, no you don't :D)
	* we will have patrick fork portality then we will make some issues on a milestone for him there. Step 1 - Patrick, fork portality. Put the link to your fork here (and make me an admin):  https://github.com/pm990320/portality
	* read about elasticsearch www.elasticsearch.org
	


TUESDAY - not here in person
	* start working on the bexcelleng and Patricks music emporium milestones
	* send emails to all@cottagelabs.com whenever you have a question
	* 1700 have a standup meeting with Mark to report progress - this means what you did, what you're doing, what is coming next, and anything blocking your progress
	* any time in the afternoon (let's suggest 1500) - an hour with Emanuil to talk about continuous integration to ensure quality code and less bugs; also a very quick overview of how we buy and manage servers.
		The DOAJ project uses three servers: test (see if things we wrote work); staging (serious testing, environment is as close to live as possible) and actual live server. DOAJ uses continuous integration to deploy all development code automatically to the test server, but it needs to also deploy all production code automatically to the staging one. If it sounds interesting Emanuil can get you started - basically you'll check what is currently being done to test and do the same thing to staging (with some changes to keep things interesting).
		Emanuil - down the bottom there is an acronyms list. Please write in there what CI is :) not sure if people have agreed to a definition yet! but will do
	

WEDNESDAY
    * AM: Fix more BeXcellent issues
    * Talked to Emanuil
    * at 14.00 I (RJ) have a Jisc Monitor webinar, if Patrick wants to attend.  Not a meeting, just a sit and listen to the project team.  May not be that interesting without more context. That would be interesting, absolutely
    * PM: Work more on portality


THURSDAY - not here in person
	* 1000 ContentMine team meeting - skype - done
	* 1100 CL team meeting - google hangout - done
	* 1600 OAButton team meeting - google hangout


FRIDAY
	* 1000 Continuing development of Bexcellent site
	* 1230 Go out for lunch!
	* 1400 review the bexcellent and music emporium milestones. Create new ones for futute work
    * 15.00 - RJ, ET and SE have their weekly DOAJ tech-team meeting.  Very informal, lots of code talk, welcome to join. google hangout & http://pads.cottagelabs.com/p/doaj
    * 1600 complete paperwork for school





People:  http://cottagelabs.com/#about  <- bio pages
    ET: Emanuil Tolev
    MM: Mark MacGillivray
    RJ: Richard Jones
    SE: Steven Eardey
    MW: Martyn Whitwell
    NA: Nevelina Aleksandrova
    LG: Laura Grantham


ACRONYMS

Over the course of the week lots of weird acronyms will pop up. Let's list what they are:

Jisc - a funding council of the UK, who fund a few of our projects with various universities - www.jisc.ac.uk

doaj - directory of open access journals - doaj.org

open access - research is done by many institutions, some paid for by tax payers, some not. Then a lot of research goes to publishers for publishing. But sometimes you have to pay to access the publication. Like a famous journal. Sometimes this is not ideal, because tax payers have paid for the research, then members of the public or public institutions like NHS staff have to pay to access it again. Now that this can be done so easily electronically via the web, this is a bit of a man in the middle inefficiency. So can we instead publish stuff directly online, and index it for people to find? Yes. 

peer-review - arxiv.org, where physicists publish research and talk about it on comments

wellcome trust - wellcome.ac.uk

continuous integration - The process of constantly integrating new features and bugfixes into one codebase and running all the automated tests. And badgering people over email if tests fail.

continuous deployment - Automatically taking all the code of a project and putting it on a server, then running it so users can benefit from the new features. Usually done together with continuous integration.

contentmine project (contentmine.org) funded by shuttleworth foundation: https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/



Thanks everyone for having me on this week's work experience, I have really loved it. Thanks for letting me sit in on the meetings and thanks Emanuil for the lecture on CI, very useful! Mark thank you very much for all your support with BeXcellent and letting me do this. Good luck with all your projects CottageLabs and once again thankyou!
~Patrick
