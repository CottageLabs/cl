<h1>OAButton. ContentMine.<br>

Combining them up?</h1>
</div> 


We've been working on a lot of projects over the last few years, and we've been  thinking of combining them up in a useful way in recent months. Coincidentally,  we met up with Joe from the Open Access Button team and we talked to him a bit  about what they are wanting to do with OAButton over the next few months. From  this wee bit of thinking and discussing and serendipity, we're now making a  proposal :)

## Our observations (which we made with the help of lots of other people)

We think open things are good - open access, open source, open people. It's not  an ideological statement, it's just a simple fact of it being an efficient way  of doing scholarship. So our only ideological commitments are that scholarship  is good and that being efficient is good - if you agree, read on.

There are a lot of different things needed in order to support an open scholarly  community. here are some:

* the ability to quickly and easily publish research findings
* somewhere to store supporting data
* access to published things and their supporting data
* access to metadata about research and educational materials
* an understanding of what can be done with what is accessible
* knowledge of any obstacles to accessing required material
* the ability to extract key information from published research
* the right to build upon prior discoveries

There are various service providers that make some of this stuff possible, and  we are glad to be involved ourselves in the capacities we have achieved so far.  But we'd like to be able to do more. This might be possible by combining up a  bunch of other projects and services, to integrate some things together so that  we can make use of some of the foundational services already available and add  to them where necessary, and to really make this open infrastructure useful.

## Our solution (for now, to be added as we progress)

So let's do that. We'll start with our own ideas for building a supporting  technical infrastructure to a number of useful services, and we will combine  that up with some recent and current projects. The key ones for now would be:

* OAG - we built this with PLoS and it provides a way to identify the licensing  conditions of a published article, and we could use this to inform people of  what they can do with a given piece of work
* ContentMine - we are working on this project for a year to develop an  infrastructure for submission, storage, and exposure of facts extracted from  published literature. Of course, the OAG data would therefore be useful to this  process, and the extracted facts are useful for all sorts of future research
* OAButton - this currently allows people to make a noise when they are denied  access to something. It could potentially also enable people to find alternative  access routes and to make (legally) copies available of stuff that is otherwise  hard to find - which would be a great resource for ContentMine

Starting with these as the user stories for our own integration developments,  we could consider the following impacts.

## What this means for OAG

OAG currently has no ongoing funding. So, in short, it's dying. By making it  relevant to wider use cases we will have motivation to support and advertise it  ourselves, and so will our partners. If it proves a useful addition to the  infrastructure then it will provide support to the argument for further funding  of all of these open tools.

So OAG should be tweaked to become a contributor of research metadata to  ContentMine.

## What this means for ContentMine

ContentMine includes a lot of work to extract data from published research, and  the storage of all this extracted data fits really closely with our own  infrastructure ideas of an academic catalogue, an index of useful research  metadata, and great tools built on top of those. ContentMine needs further proof  by showing how much useful information can be extracted and shared, so combining  up with OAG and OAButton could do that.

So the ContentMine backend should be one and the same as the CL infrastrucutre  plan, and it should support OAG and OAButton as contributing services.

## What this means for OAButton

OAButton is doing a good job of building a community and getting people to use  and contribute to the button itself. However it needs a lot of development done  to provide a stable backend and API so that further frontend functionality can  be easily supported in future. But, OAButton is short of funds at the moment.

So OAButton should become a contributor to ContentMine, thus getting the backend  functionality it needs whilst also being a good user story to drive that  development.

## What next

We need agreement that OAG, ContentMine, and OAButton should be combined up in  this way with our infrastructure developments! Those of you who can commit to  this - you know who you are - get in touch (well, we've probably already talked  to you).

We need to develop our infrastructure in line with ContentMine and OAButton  (and some of our own) user stories, and refactor OAG a bit to fit.

We need to promote this to the wider community and get further feedback - if you  have been reading this article and wanting to have your say or get involved,  now is the time!
