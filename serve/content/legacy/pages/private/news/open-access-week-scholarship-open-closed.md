Continuing the presentation of my Studies in Open Scholarship work for Open Access Week 2013, I will describe the first of the eight listed topics - <b>open vs closed scholarship</b>.

But first, an explanation of the (seemingly) binary nature of the topics. It is, of course, the case that such clear-cut definitions are not realistic; they are not intended to be. Instead, they are eight spectra within which we continue our discussions of what scholarship <i>should</i> be; their purpose, then, is to differentiate our <i>shoulds</i> from what <i>is</i>. Scholarship is, and we discuss what we think it should be.

This is why the first topic is <b>open vs closed</b>. Why should something like scholarship require a prefix? What do we need that <i>open</i> for? What does it define for us that scholarship does not? What is the meaning of <i>closed</i> scholarship, that it would necessitate an <i>open</i> counterpart?

This Open Access Week is one of many events, activities and communities that all share the commonality of openness. Recent years have seen a lot of progress in this regard, as evidenced by the various government mandates for open access to the output of publicly funded research. But of course, these mandates are taken as both good and bad progress - some consider them as paragons of open achievement, whereas others are disappointed by their lack of clarity or commitment to certain aspects of different definitions of open.

This is because <b>open</b> is not in itself a straightforward statement, as there are many variations of what open means, and differing contexts such as access, software, and data for which the technicalities require further detail.

Whilst the nuances of openness may hint at what the antithesis is, there is little evidence to suggest that scholarship is regularly considered to be closed. Of course there may be scholarly activities that are closed to us, and we do not know about them. But at least in terms of the statements of intent of public scholarly institutions, scholarship is never defined as something restrictive or restricted.

When our scholarly institutions make statements about scholarship - and when most individuals describe their understanding of scholarship - it is just that; <b>scholarship</b>, with no pretence as to a spectrum of accessibility, but an implicit assumption that scholarly materials are available and that new outputs are shared with others who may benefit from or build upon them. This is scholarship in itself.

It is in trying to realise our scholarly ideals that we encounter obstacles; physical restrictions in our technical ability to disseminate knowledge, and emotional reasons for restricting access to certain information, lead to compromises. Then, attempts to maintain or progress from compromise give rise to the discussions and disagreements that are presently manifest by the <b>open</b> debate.

So this is what <b>open vs closed</b> is about - not a proposed extension to the term <b>scholarship</b> or to any of the other words where we encounter open as prefix, but an acknowledgement of our own efforts towards an ideal. <b>Open</b>, therefore, is not a state of scholarship but the term we use to refer to our efforts to progress towards a state.

By stating whether or not we expect scholarship to be open or closed, we do not affect the state of scholarship; we make a statement about what we want our scholarly society to be. Then, we can do something about it.

If you want to contribute to this statement, please take part in my survey; it is available now, or if you would like more information first, wait until the end of OA week for my complete series of topical posts.
