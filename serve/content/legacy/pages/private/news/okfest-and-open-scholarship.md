<h1>OKFest and open scholarship</h1>
<p><br >This week I and others from Cottage Labs have been spending time at the <a href="http://www.okfestival.org">Open Knowledge Festival</a>. Apart from all the generally exciting open stuff going on, and the bits and pieces relevant to the various CL projects in this area - such as <a href="/projects/jiscopenbib2">JISC Open Bib</a> - I have also considered this an opportunity to present an initial immersion into the community within which I wish to situate my PhD fieldwork.</p>

## What is the purpose of the fieldwork?

My intention in this exercise is to observe actors in the process of attempting to performing scholarly activities, and to learn from them how they achieve their goals and how they construct the social network within which they do so. As you may be able to guess from this description if you are conversant with approaches to sociological research, I will be utilising an [Actor-Network theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory) approach.

By performing this observation, I will learn more about and present a clear elucidation of the boundary between open and closed scholarship from varying perspectives. My hypothesis is that the boundary is purely a socio-technical construct, and that lack of clarity over its' definition hinders scholarship . It is not my intention to influence the workings of one or other particular social group, but to clearly identify what it is that truly drives and sustains a particular social group, so that perhaps a clearer picture of what scholarship is can emerge. However, as I very much function as a person that must "do" rather than only "discuss", I will go on to use what I learn to offer a solution that will help those who wish to rid themselves of unnecessary distinctions between "open" and "closed" forms of what they are truly interested in - e.g. "scholarship" - to do so.

## How does this relate to OKFest?

OKFest is a festival of "open" - Open Knowledge, Data, Science, Art, Humanities, and anything else to which the prefix "open" could be applied; which, interestingly, is virtually anything. The festival represents probably the largest coming together of people from across the world on a platform of "open" in recent European history. As such it should present an excellent environment for observation of actors operating within the "open scholarship" network. It will be interesting to discover what sort of a cross-section of different sorts of members of this "open" community are represented at the event.

## What did I find?

The attendees at OKFest presented a much more diverse collection of people than I expected - the events I typically attend have a far more technical orientation, whereas here there are people across a very wide range of interest. However, all are of course interested in "open" something, and on the whole are of the opinion that "open" is a good thing - there is little debate on that point.

This in itself is interesting - whereas a few years ago this sort of event would involve a lot of argumentation over whether or not open access was even a good idea, it has reached a point now where over a thousand people can come together as a united front under an "open" banner, with little in the way of dissent.

## A specific example

open science panel discussion - preaching to the choir - people ready to do stuff - CC man asks what actually is the problem, access or cost? are we all just bitching?

## What is missing

where are the people who try to access information but have trouble doing so? what actually is the problem? there were quite a few examples, but on the whole, people seemed to have access to what they wanted. So what - at least from an academic perspective - is missing?

## Validity

The key point is validity. people have varying degrees of need for validation of information that they are willing to absorb without question. For scientists, it is ostensibly quite high, although in reality of course, any system can be gamed and poor quality slips in. If we could provide that validity, by differing degrees for varying groups, could the problem of "Open" vs "closed" be dissolved?

## Feasibility

There is little doubt that this is absolutely technically feasible. But it requires communities willing to experiment.
