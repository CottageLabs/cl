<h1 style="color: #ED1C24; padding bottom: 10px">This Month at the Lab: February 2013</h1>
<p>February has been both brilliant and hectic for us here at CL! We had our awesome trip to Brussels for <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/">Fosdem 2013</a> which you can read all about in our <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/FOSDEM2013">blog post.</a> It was great to have the chance to all get together for geekery and waffles and a good time was had by all :D</p> 
<p>It hasn't all been jet-setting and confectionery, however! We've been working really hard on our internal projects over the course of the month and have made good progress with some of the website updates and our new admin system, and we're delighted to welcome Laura to the Lab! Laura has been doing a brilliant job so far of helping us out with our admin :D</p>
<p>We were also happy to hear that <a href="http://www.ourtownstories.co.uk/">Our Town Stories</a>, one of the projects we worked on last year with the lovely people at <a href="http://eskimoonline.com/">Eskimo Design</a>, was mentioned in The Scotsman newspaper. Check out the article <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-through-the-ages-shown-in-new-archive-1-2805541">here</a>.

<h2>Project Updates</h2>
<p>A rundown of all the goings-on with our projects in February:</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/duo">Duo</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> The University of Oslo are redeveloping their digital repository system to be based on the <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a> platform, and integrating with a number of parts of the Norwegian National Infrastructure including <a href="https://www.studweb.no/">StudentWeb/FS</a> for masters theses and <a href="http://www.cristin.no/">CRISTIN</a> for national research information, as well as the national research repository <a href="http://www.ub.uio.no/nora/search.html">NORA</a> and ultimately the national archive <a href="http://www.arkivverket.no/arkivverket/Arkivverket/Riksarkivet">Riksarkivet</a>.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> to develop the requirements and technical approach, and are developing the software to integrate all of these systems.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing, nearly complete!</p>
<p>This project is fairly near completion; Richard did some work sorting out a bug fix, but the next step is his trip to Oslo to do the workshop in June.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/ukriss">UKRISS</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> to conduct a feasibility and scoping study for the reporting of research information at a national level based on CERIF, with the objective of increasing efficiency, productivity and quality across the sector.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Our aim is to define and prototype solutions which will be compelling, easy to use, have a low entry barrier, and support innovative information sharing and benchmarking.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>There has been a fair bit of progress with phase 2 this month; we had our initial face-to-face meeting where we discussed the project plan. The plan is due to be approved later this week and will be published on the project <a href="http://ukriss.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/">blog</a>. If you fancy checking out the appendices to our feasibility study, they will also be appearing there this week. Richard attended a meeting with the UK CERIF interest group to gauge the implications for this project, and the general conclusion was that the group provides a useful set of contacts and consultative group for UKRISS that is worth engaging with for this project.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/resourcesync">ResourceSync</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> ResourceSync is a standardisation effort - under the guide of NISO - around change communication and resource synchronisation on the web.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Design an approach for resource synchronization aligned with the Web Architecture that has a fair chance of adoption by different communities. The approach must scale better than recurrent HTTP HEAD/GET on resources.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>Richard has been getting some feedback on the use-cases that were developed for this project, and we are preparing to move into the development stage. The plan is to implement an OAI-PMH replacement for DSpace using ResourceSync, developing some useful code artefacts in the process.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/oxforddmponline">OxfordDmpOnline</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> Oxford DMPOnline is a project working with the <a href="http://ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a> and the <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/">Digital Curation Centre (DCC)</a> to deploy the new <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/">DMPOnline</a> software as a service within Oxford.  In addition to giving extensive feedback to the development of DMPOnline, we are also testing the limits of the localised deployments of this central service and working with the DCC to find the best ways to approach such deployments.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Test the limits of the localised deployments of this central service, and find the best ways to approach such deployments. Implement <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2">SWORD 2.0</a> to allow Data Management Plans to be deposited directly from the service to the institution's local digital repository.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing, nearly complete!</p>
<p>Richard and Martyn continued to work on a few fixes and tweaks; Martyn updated the test installation with new questions from David Shotton, the latest version can be viewed <a href="http://zoo-stack01.zoo.ox.ac.uk/">here</a>. There has been a a silo in DataBank at the Bodleian set up to use for deposit, the first of which you can find <a href=" http://astros-dev.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/dmponline/datasets/new-deposit-plan_2013-02-27T17-46-15">here</a>. We are waiting on feedback from David Shotton on some tweaks Martyn made to the formatting and questions.</p>
<br>
<h3>G4HE</h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> G4HE is a JISC-funded project which aims to engage with the BIS-funded RCUK Gateway to Research (GtR) initiative to improve the information exchange between Higher Education Institutions and the Research Councils.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> To develop tools and interfaces to allow both human and machine access to data held on GtR, and elsewhere where that is required. The project will also develop recommendations on enabling the improved data to be re-harvested from institutional systems into RC systems, and thereby improving the data held by GtR.</p>
<p><b>Status: </b> Ongoing</p>
<p>February has been a busy month on this project; Richard, Bex and Mark attended a face-to-face meeting in sunny Birmingham where we triaged the use cases. The 6 that were chosen as most relevant went out to the ARMA members for feedback, which was then summarised and compiled into detailed use cases. Meanwhile, Mark and Richard began work on planning out the technical implementation. </p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/opencitations">OpenCitations</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b>Open Citations is a database of biomedical literature citations, harvested from the reference lists of all open access articles in PubMed Central that reference ~20% of all PubMed Central papers (approx. 3.4 million papers), including all the highly cited papers in every biomedical field. We are currently upgrading that database to incorporate data from arXiv and CrossRef.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b>  a new set of user interface tools, visualisations, and a REST API for accessing the data.<p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p> We have made good progress on this project over the course of this month, with Mark and Martyn succeeding in writing code to import the entire PubMed Open Access archive and also to import OAI-PMH feeds. You can check out what we have done so far <a href="http://occ.cottagelabs.com/">here</a>, and if you like lovely bubble graphs (we do!), check <a href="http://occ.cottagelabs.com/graphview/">this view</a> out! 
<br>
<h2>This month in the community</h2>
<p> As developers who use Python in a lot of our projects, we were pretty shocked to hear this month about the legal battle taking place between the <a href="http://python.org/psf/"><strong>Python Software Foundation</strong></a> and a UK hosting company over the trademark of the term "Python." The PSF are looking for UK companies who work with the language to get in touch to help them make the case for the term having been in long-term use worldwide to refer to the programming language that we know and love. Check out our <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/helpthePSF">blog post</a> to see how you can help and for an example letter. </p> 
<p>We were really pleased to hear that earlier this month, the president's Office of Science and Technology Policy in the USA announced that <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=422829#.USuSTNgZ8Xo.twitter"><strong>all new taxpayer-funded research</strong></a> must be made available free of charge to the public within a year of publication. While there is still a long way to go, this comes as brilliant news to the OA community and is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
