Continuing the presentation of my Studies in Open Scholarship work for Open Access Week 2013, the fifth and sixth topics jointly consider whether <b>contributing to scholarship should be cheap or profitable</b> and whether <b>access to scholarly contributions should be free or costly</b>.






The questions of restriction and exclusivity are therefore not ones regarding the qualities of scholarship, but regarding our capability to reach new scholarly heights; they are the boundaries we can reach within the capabilties available to us, and they are the comfortable plateaux we must cross and abandon in order to tackle greater problems.

If you want to contribute to this statement, please take part in my survey; it is available now, or if you would like more information first, wait until the end of OA week for my complete series of topical posts.
