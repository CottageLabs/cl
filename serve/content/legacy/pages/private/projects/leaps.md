**Project Summary**

This project aims to modernise the Lothian Equal Access Program for Schools workflow by replacing paper-based applications and interview mechanisms with online equivalents, and bringing additional benefits in the process by improving efficiency, reducing repetitive data entry tasks, and reducing error rates.

LEAPS are a good example of a small team that serve a large distributed community, and that report to multiple interested parties. Also, given their aim of improving access to further and higher education, they are ideal for Cottage Labs to work with, as we can bring technical expertise to their community activities and help them to achieve an aim with which we strongly identify.
