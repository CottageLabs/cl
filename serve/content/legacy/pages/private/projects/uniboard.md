<p>UniBoard is a successful Jisc Student Summer of Innovation project from 2013, which explored the possibility of a student/institution-oriented market place for second-hand goods.</p>
<p>UniBoard was founded by Matt, a first year student studying at the University of Birmingham Business School. Matt enjoys creativity and innovation, and welcomes conversation through <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/matthewbeveridge/">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Since then, Jisc has approved further funding to develop the idea into a pilot service, to focus around the exchange of used text books in a university setting, taking into account the location of the book (so it is easy to collect) and the relevance of the book to the course reading lists.</p>
<p>Cottage Labs have joined the UniBoard team to provide the technical development and hosting of the solution, to turn the idea into a reality.</p>
<p>Over the coming summer we will be working to run a pilot service at <a href="http://brunel.ac.uk">Brunel University</a></p>
