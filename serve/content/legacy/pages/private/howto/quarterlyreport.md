# How to do a Cottage Labs quarterly report

Every quarter we generate a report of our incomings and outgoings on projects in the quarter. This consists of listing all the payments in on projects, subtracting any VAT we have to pay to HMRC, then listing all the costs on those projects; then we calculate how much each partner could be due to receive that quarter. BUT, before paying out, we then consider any CL operating costs incurred on our own internal projects, subtract from that any payments from other projects to cover those costs, and make a percentage reduction of the amounts due to partners. Finally, we take account of any payments or subtractions due to each partner in the quarter.

During this process, we also compare our bank statement with our invoices list, check our VAT payments, and write a report document, thus tidying up our records for the quarter. The instructions below explain how to do this.


1. Go to the Cottage Labs Finance folder in the CL google docs collection. In the Reports folder, create a new folder titled by the quarter - for example, December 2012. This is the folder to which all relevant information about this quarterly report should be stored.

2. Sign in to the CL Co-operative bank account. Under "accounts information" select "transactions". Select the CL account from the drop-down accounts list. Set the date range from the first day of the relevant quarter - for example 01/10/2012, up to the last day of the relevant quarter - for example 31/12/2012. Click "go". Then on the next page click "reports". Select "csv" then click "generate report". Once downloaded to your local PC, upload it into the google docs report folder, converting it to google spreadsheet format in the process. There will be extra rows in the spreadsheet where page breaks appeared in the bank output. Remove those extra rows (see a previous qaurterly bank statement if you want to check which ones to remove). Add a column to the right of the spreadsheet entitled OUR NOTES. Go through each payment and note what they are all for - see a previous quarter bank statement for examples. It should note which project each payment is a cost or an income against, or explain any extraneous transactions.

3. Go into the CL Finance folder and find the Invoices spreadsheet. Go through all the billings and expenditures and update them to show whether they have been paid or not, and look for any from the previous quarter that are still outstanding for any reason. Add notes to any invoices that remain outstanding to explain why they will not be paid until the next quarter - e.g. because the customer has not paid them, project delayed, or whatever the reason may be.

4. In the Reports folder in the CL finance folder, find the quarterly report calculations template and right click it and select to make a copy. Do this also for the quarterly report document template. Then, move both the copies into the current quarter report folder, and rename them as appropriate for the current quarter.

5. In the folder for this quarter, open the newly created calculations spreadsheet and fill it in for this quarter (look at the previous quarter spreadsheet for examples). 

6. BLUE SECTION - List all projects that have had income to the bank account this quarter in the light blue area. Note that this must be inclusive of VAT with an ex VAT figure specified in the ex VAT column; if the project is not invoiced with VAT - e.g. the customer is outside the EU, then put the same number in the income and ex VAT columns. In the costs column, put a total figure for all costs incurred by the given project this quarter. Use the costs notes box to explain how this figure is arrived at. List all the CL project payments / costs separately in the darker blue sections. By identifying costs on the projects that have had income this quarter, and specifying which of those costs are payments to the internal CL project, then listing all the costs to the CL project this quarter, the spreadsheet will calculate the total overall costs, and the amount available for payment to partners this quarter, as well as the amount required for VAT on the income this quarter. Make sure that if you add or remove rows that you check the TOTALS line at the bottom still has SUM functions that include all rows.

7. GREEN SECTION - The data required for this section should be available in the CL Projects spreadsheet; if it is not, then query the project leader to provide it. If it is not provided, do not make any payments for the project. For every project listed with income, insert the partner percentage share allocated to each partner in the given project. These MUST be percentages. If a partner is due a fixed payment on any project, this should be taken account of in the BLUE project costs column. Once these figures are inserted (use zero values to indicate when a partner has been considered but is not due anything, to know the sheet is complete) the spreadsheet will show the % partner adjustment value in the bright green box (this is like the old CL X). The dark green line will then show the actual amounts available to each partner. After this line, there is space to add any additional partner payments; for example, if a partner was listed as due a fixed cost on any project e.g. for doing bid writing then the payment to the partner should be listed here. After this, there is space to list any deductions from partners - e.g. any amounts used at their request towards particular projects. Once these sections are complete, then the actual total payments to make to partners will be calculated in the bottom bright green line. The total outgoing amount will be shown in the red box. Again, make sure that if you add or remove rows that you check these totals at the bottom still have SUM functions that include all rows.

8. ORANGE SECTION - List here any costs still owed to the CL project; for example, if a cost was paid on a project for which no income arrived this quarter, then that amount is outstanding. The red box will show the total amount still owed. If there are any closed projects owing money, this money should be reclaimed from the partners involved in that project.

9. DARK RED SECTION - At the bottom, there is a dark red section; in the top box, enter the total amount of money in the CL bank account at the end of the current quarter. The current state will then be calculated, based on this figure and the other red figures on the spreadsheet - amount in bank minus amount due for VAT minus amounts payable to partners. This should be around zero, although due to fluctuations in VAT payments it can vary. If it becomes too negative for prolonged periods, the bank account may become short of funds to pay VAT and other bills and a re-alignment will be required, involving reduced payments to partners.

10. Open the newly created quarterly report document in the current quarterly report folder; it will mostly be empty. Work through it, filling in each part by refererring to the values in the calculations spreadsheet; it should be possible to identify any discrepancies between the bank statement spreadsheet, the invoices spreadsheet, and the calculations spreadsheet at this stage.

11. If there are any unexplained transactions, or projects lacking sufficient detail to enable completion of the quarterly report, send an email to all@cottagelabs.com listing all the problems and asking for immediate explanation. When explanations are received, update the report document accordingly. If explanations are not forthcoming, note the problem and remove any related payments from partner payment calculations - payments will not be made where there is project information lacking. If there are any unexplained costs going out of the CL accounts, raise the issue with CL partners in person or via partners@cottagelabs.com.

12. Once all information is received and the report is adequately completed, email partners@cottagelabs.com asking for +1 from all partners that they are happy with the report (put link to it in the email, although all partners should have access to the CL folders anyway). Ask partners when they are free for a quarterly report meeting as soon as possible. Once +1 from all partners has been received, update the report to indicate this; hold the quarterly report meeting. Make any final adjustments.

13. Pay the partners. Each partner should receive a payment for their percentages due, and a separate payment for any expenses due. See documentation on how to make a payment from the CL bank account (once it exists).
