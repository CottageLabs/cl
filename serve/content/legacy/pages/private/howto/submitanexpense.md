Expenses are complicated. There are various ways to deal with them, and you must be careful how you do so.

# Managing expenses at a personal level

For anything you spend personally that is related to your work as a self-employed person, you should keep a copy of the receipt. Then at the end of the tax year when you submit your taxes, you can list all of these expenses and count them off against all the income you received, thus reducing your taxable income and reducing your tax bill.

Whether or not (and how) you do this is entirely up to you and is of no relevance to Cottage Labs - it is the same whether you are counting expenses and income in relation to Cottage Labs work or in relation to any other self employed work you do.

A convenient way to manage these personal expenses is to write a note on the receipt you receive then take a photo of it with your smartphone. Then at regular intervals you can organise the pictures and save them as evidence of your expenses for each tax year.


# Managing expenses at a project level

It is not possible to define one way in which all projects should manage their expenes, as it depends on what is suitable in each case for the client and for the project. However, we have a preferred method:


## Preferred expense management method from a CL project perspective

The preferred method is to take no account of expenses whatsoever at the project level. Your project proposal should propose a cost for the WORK you will do for a customer, and when you write that proposal you should consider what the likely impact of expenses will be on that project. For example, if you offer to do ten days work at Â£400 per day for a customer who requires you to travel every working day in a way that leads you to incur a cost of 50 each day, then you should quote to do ten days of work at Â£450 per day. When the customer pays the money via CL, you will receive your payment as usual for the work you did on that project. Then, when you declare your own personal tax at the end of the year, you can take account of the travel expenses you incurred to reduce your overall taxable income. As there are no explicitly declared expenses on the invoices in this scenario, Cottage Labs will have no interest in your expenses.


## Alternative expenses management for when the customer requires expenses to be explicitly declared and claimed

There is a preferred method in this scenario too:

### Preferred method for managing explicitly declared expenses

If a customer wishes to pay directly for expenses incurred by you during a project, then where possible you should seek to submit expenses to that customer directly and outside of the invoicing process via CL. E.g. if you quote to work for ten days at Â£400 per day and you must incur a cost of Â£50 per day in travel that the customer wishes to pay directly for, you should invoice via Cottage Labs for the Â£400 per day work as usual and you should send DIRECTLY to the customer a personal claim for reimbursement of the Â£50 daily travel costs. NOTE in this case that it is ALSO in your interests to retain copies of these expenses for your personal records, so that when you do your personal taxes at the end of the year you can prove these expenses existed. However in this case, Cottage Labs will have no interest in your expenses.


### Non-preferred method for managing explicitly declared expenses

The case occasionally arises where a customer wishes to pay expenses but requires that those expenses be explicitly declared in the project proposal AND that they be claimed WITH the project invoices. In this case, the expenses must traverse the CL bank account and so CL WILL have an interest in your expenses. This is the most complex option as it involves duplication of effort, and should be avoided if at all possible.

In this case, you should continue to keep a record of your own expenses and copies of your receipts for your personal tax return. You should also provide copies of the receipts to the customer when required to do so in order to claim the expenses back with the invoices that get sent to the customer. You MUST also enter these expenses on the CL accounting software - showing the amount, what they were for, which project they relate to, and uploading a copy of the expense receipt as well. Then, when CL receives payment of the invoices that included the claims for expenses, the money will be available for you. At this point, you can invoice CL for your income on the project for the days you worked, AND you can list the expenses that you wish to be reimbursed.

In these cases, the CL administrator will be keeping an eye on any expense records added to the CL accounting software and will ask you to fix any errors.

In the cases where you must manage expenses in this way but do not have access to the CL accounting software (for example, anyone below partner level will probably not be given such access) then you must confirm witht the relevant project leader how expenses should be handled. The project leader, in such cases, may require you to upload expense receipt copies to a particular location so that the project leader can then record them on open books.

If additional help is required in managing and tracking expenses and in keeping the CL accounting software up to date, this assistance can be purchased from the CL administrator either from project or personal budgets - however it is NOT inclusive in the default service provided by the CL administrator as part of the standard CL overhead charges.
