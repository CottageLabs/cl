#How To Claim for an Event

Sometimes you will want to go to an event that is not covered by one of your projects, and for this you may incur personal costs both real (train tickets, accommodation, etc), and implied (a day off when you could be doing paid work).  In these circumstances you may be able to claim all or part of your financial liabilities from Cottage Labs central accounts.

To do this, provide a brief summary of the events and reasons for claiming to the partners, which will include information such as:

* what the event is
* what the overall cost to you will be
* what cost you would like to claim from Cottage Labs
* why the event is beneficial to the lab as a whole

The partners will then agree on a case-by-case basis whether the cost can be bourne by Cottage Labs.  The decision will rest on factors such as:

* whether the partners agree that the event is beneficial to the lab in part or as a whole
* whether there is sufficient spare funds in the Cottage Labs accounts to cover you

Since payments to a partner to attend an event will impact on the CLX for that quarter, they will be considered carefully before being approved.
