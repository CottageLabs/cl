# How to submit a VAT return for Cottage Labs

NOTE: from April 2013 we expect VAT returns to be done by the accountant, but if this changes in future, this is what we must do.

Our VAT returns are due quarterly, and our quarterly periods for VAT run from Jan 31st. So, on Jan 31st we are due to submit a VAT return, and again on April 30th, and so on. After the due date we have 28 days to submit the return for that period.

VAT returns should be submitted via the HMRC website, logging in with the CL login and password, then selecting to submit a VAT return.

* download transaction listing for period from the bank
* in the VAT returns spreadsheet separate out the debits and credits
* separate out the VAT from individual transactions and add useful notes such as "payments to partners" where transactions are not obvious
* sum the net and VAT debit and credit figures and enter in the "Returns" sheet as per colour coding, this gives you exactly the info you need to enter into the VAT returns online form
* go to https://online.hmrc.gov.uk
* log-in (user ID 656435977557) and select VAT returns and the relevant period
* enter figures from spreadsheet
* submit
* file pdf copy in google docs 


The CL Admin google docs folder includes a folder called VAT returns, which contains PDF copies of the VAT returns previously submitted and the spreadsheet where calculations are made.

Note that we MUST invoice people INCLUSIVE of VAT regardless of who they are, if they are based anywhere in the EU. They must pay us the cost plus VAT of the work we did. We must pay that VAT back to the government, less any deductions we can apply for things we bought.

NOTE also that Norway does not appear to be in the EU for VAT purposes, so it should not be invoiced inclusive of VAT.

Any amounts that we are paid from people who are not VAT invoicable should not be included in our statement of earnings for VAT purposes.
