Next thing is to create a contact so we can have projects with them

Then we would create an estimate (quote for work) and once we hear it is approved we can mark it as approved.

Once work is done, we can click to convert the estimate to an invoice, then send it off, and mark it as sent.

then it is added to our invoice timeline, so we can see when it has gone overdue (after one month)


Then we can do banking

When we upload our bank statements, we can reconcile the incoming payments with the invoices that were sent.

If CSV files are downloaded from our bank account every month, they can be sent to the accountant and he will upload them.

The CSV can be converted using the website

If we did to it, you would go to banking then upload statement.

NEVER tick the "guess transactions" box cos it gets them  wrong

It finds all the new transactions. Go through them and click on them and select the transactions (previous invoices) that the payments incoming are for.

Make sure to check the suggested matches are correct.

We can also match expenses to particular projects.

Where we incur expenses that were relevant to a particular project, they can be tagged against that project without re-invoicing the client for it.

When we receive bills from someone - e.g. we owe them money for work they did for us - then we create a bill. Then we pay it from our bank. Then when we upload the bank transactions, we can reconcile them and then we can upload the invoice they sent us as the evidence of that bill.
