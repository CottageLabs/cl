<p>I work at CL because I care deeply about open access to scholarship, like doing software well and learn a lot from Cottage Labs' modus operandi. Convincing people to hire you or seeing them come back because you did a good job teaches you a lot about people, business, how to get things done and how our society actually works. I write and use open source software. I will read almost any work of fiction, especially fantasy and sci-fi. Spend a lot of my free time cooking and thinking up ways to get thousands of stray animals to potential adopters.</p>
