                        <p>Cottage labs is looking for a UK based remote software engineer with at least two years of
                            experience to join our team of data and software experts. Proximity to the rest of the team
                            in Oxford, Milton Keynes or Edinburgh would be preferred for regular online calls and
                            occasional in-person meetings.</p>

                        <h3>The role</h3>
                        <p>We’re looking for a self-motivated developer who’s worked as part of a software dev team
                            before looking to contribute to a variety of projects for clients all over the world. Key
                            responsibilities include:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Contributing high quality code, tests, and documentation to projects</li>
                            <li>Collaborating with project team members - discussing approaches to new features,
                                reviewing pull requests, pair programming where applicable etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>Communicating effectively with clients - attending meetings where possible, engaging
                                with queries and technical questions relating to projects
                            </li>
                            <li>Keeping up-to-date with best practice and promising new technologies</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>How we work</h3>
                        <p>The whole team at Cottage Labs has always worked remotely. We regularly collaborate on
                            projects by pairing over zoom and we have an active Slack workspace where support is
                            available. So do people we work with; you may be hopping between channels talking to various
                            interesting people throughout the day.</p>

                        <p>We meet up in person from time to time (expenses will be covered) and have a weekly catch-up
                            during work hours to keep in touch. We’re also open to flexible working arrangements.</p>

                        <h3>Our stack</h3>
                        <p>As we have some ongoing work and prospects involving the Samvera Hyrax repository software,
                            we’d like to increase our in-house expertise. In addition, Cottage Labs has a variety of
                            long-term projects in numerous programming languages, so any additional languages and
                            interests would benefit us. We also require knowledge of version control.</p>

                        <p>Demonstrated experience in digital library applications or related application domains would
                            be a bonus. </p>

                            <li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>

                            <li>Knowledge of version control</li>
                        </ul>

                        </ul>

                        <p>In addition to development, it may be necessary to perform deployments and diagnosis of
                            running systems, for which familiarity with Linux servers, remote access via SSH, and wider
                            knowledge of web hosting would be useful.</p>
