# Regulation for Scientific Research
<br>

Today the Guardian published an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/jul/28/scientific-fraud-regulation">article</a> [<a href="#1">1</a>] about the possibility of introducing government controlled regulation into scientific research. I have not read the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/856/85602.htm">report</a> [<a href="#2">2</a>] yet; perhaps it makes more sense than the article...

I am somewhat confused by the purpose of such regulation (at least as purported by the Guardian article). Is the purpose:

* to discover incorrect or fraudulent research?
* to issue certification that a particular institute or group is meeting requirements?

Whilst the article does allude to the difference, it does not make clear the impact of either case. Let's analyse those two possibilities.

## Discovering incorrect or fraudulent research

If this is the purpose, it is futile. Identifying invalid research <em>requires</em> research; this is precisely why research is disseminated, and why the scientific method is based on falsifiability. If something <em>could</em> be correct, we know everything necessary to show that it is, or not.

Anyone that presumes any particular scientific paper - or any utterance via any communication method in any language by any human - is in some way <em>true</em>, is simply completely wrong. No statements that we ever make convey truth or falsity; all they do is convey information. It is then up to the person receiving such information to use it or not.

Certainly, there is an element of trust; we trust colleagues to publish data that accurately represents the observations they performed during a particular experiment; and we often choose not to check that for ourselves. The alternative to this would be to progress at a speed of 1 - we could never scale up our research endeavours, because we could only ever rely on what we had directly observed.

So, it seems unlikely that the regulator is going to perform this function. 

## Issuing certification that a group is meeting requirements

If this is the purpose, then what requirements must be met? What is the exemplar research group? It cannot be based on the output of that group - that, again, would require actually validating the output of the research group in question, which is itself just research. Perhaps it is that they all promise not to lie? Well, perhaps; but they still might - more importantly, they are still likely to get things wrong by accident, and yet again, identifying that is a function of research itself.

Perhaps a certified group or institute proves that it has a person or a team on hand that ensure the work of their colleagues meets requirements? Well, what would those requirements be? A promise not to cheat? A promise never to make a mistake? Or will this person or team be charged with testing every theory espoused by their colleagues - and in the process essentially becoming an active researcher on every topic their colleagues are expert in? Seems unlikely.

## But other industries, like restaurants, have regulation...

Yes. They do. And the regulations check the state of the equipment they use to produce their art. The regulations check that the staff meet health and hygiene requirements. The regulations check that illegal materials are not used in the production. These are all things that are already covered in any scientific lab by similar regulations - on managing hazardous chemicals, on employee safety, and so on. but government regulation does not demand that a particular restaurant produce food of some sort of platonic ideal standard (which would be impossible to do, and impossible to test), nor that the restaurateurs themselves are perfectly honest and infallible people. So, yet again I wonder, what is this further regulation going to provide for the research community, or those that consume its' output?

## Slighting the scientific method

The article refers to the scientific "method" as if it is some secret trick researchers use to defend their right to publish whatever they want with a badge of secret authority. But it is not; fairly simply, it is this:

* observe something
* record data about the observation
* make a conjecture about the recorded data
* observe something else to find out if that conjecture holds
* report it
* move on - and start again

And the peer review process does this:

* review reported data
* check it accurately represents the observation, by performing another observation (or by guessing)
* confirm or deny the previous findings
* move on - and start again

Once a conjecture passes this test, we can interweave it with our other observations to produce an overall theory - a picture. We then spend <em>the rest of our lives</em> checking that picture over and over again for errors, and fixing them where we discover them.

## Research output is (unfortunately) not strawberry cheesecake (most of the time)

If we were in the restaurant business, all of our restaurants would fail - because we would never sell anything. The purpose of research is not to make a product fit for consumption but to make an accurate representation of the state of the world around us. Research is what enables us to do and create other things; like strawberry cheesecake. When Heston Blumenthal makes all those weird mixtures of food and comes up with bizarre tastes and concoctions, the government do not check if he has <em>done it right</em>. They have nothing to say on the matter, because they are not expert chefs. They might send someone round to check the kitchen is clean though. Journalists, on the other hand, have plenty to say about it - some of it informative, some of it based on no expertise in the field. Then they publish it to everyone - but no expert chef takes it seriously, unless the author <em>also</em> happens to have some additional authority with which to weight their commentary.

## Improving peer review

Without doubt, we <em>could</em> improve the peer review process. We could reduce the guesswork component by increasing the number of people that can check the work. We could do this simply by demanding that the output (including any published papers) of every single academic research project that receives any government funding is completely open to the people that funded it - the public. That way, <em>anyone</em> with the time and skill to do so can check the validity of the work. This may have been difficult a few years ago, when publishing was a costly activity; but now, we could do it easily and for free, using the technology at our disposal - e.g. all that evil stuff that the MPAA does not like because - oh no! - it allows us to copy data and communicate with other people easier than ever before.

So, what we do <em>not</em> want is in-house regulation of something that cannot be regulated - and what we do <em>not</em> want is publication that limits disseminability to a select few.

If the government wishes to do <em>anything</em> useful regarding peer review, it can mandate that all research output is made fully public wherever possible. Perhaps the full report says this - as I admitted, I have not read it; it is quite long, and I have other work to finish tonight. But if that report does not say it, then here it is:

# What we need is open scholarship

Help us get it. End of story.
