#British Library Gateway-to-Research Hack Day
<br>

<div class=row-fluid>

<div class=span6>
   
   <p>Gateway-to-Research is an RCUK datasource which provides access to information about funding which has been awarded, thus showing the public expenditure on research in the UK</p>
   
   <p>As part of their Beautiful Science exhibition, the British Library are running a hack day and subsequent competition around using interesting visualisations to explore the GtR data, or to tell a story using it.</p>
   
   <p>With our experience of the GtR data via the G4HE project, and with our long history of attending and helping to run developer-focussed events, we are helping the BL plan and execute this day.</p>
