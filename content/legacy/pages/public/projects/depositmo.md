**Project Summary**

DepositMO is creating links between the user's desktop and their digital repository.  This involves creating two user tools which connect to the repository using the <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2/" title="SWORD 2.0">SWORDv2</a> protocol:

<ol>
<li><strong>A Microsoft Word Add-In</strong>: this allows the user to deposit DocX document directly from their word authoring environment into the repository.</li>
<li><strong>Watch Folder</strong>: this creates a connection between a folder on the user's desktop to the repository, allowing for two-way synchronisation of resources in the folder.</li>
</ol>

We were brought into the project at a late stage to meet some urgent requirements which the project had not been able to fulfill: to implement the extensions to SWORDv2 that DepositMO utilised against the <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a> repository platform, and to extract data from DocX files and images with embedded XIF data for that system.
