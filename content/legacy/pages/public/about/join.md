<h1>Join Us</h1>

Cottage Labs is a group of freelance developers<!--writers, analysts or not really anymore?--> who work with Open Source Software. We specialise in developing software and producing reports for the Higher Education sector, as well as working with a number of commercial and charitable <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/about/organisations">organisations</a>.</p> 

We are always interested in meeting new people who might like to work with us. If you are a developer with an interest in Open Source, there are a few different ways that you can get involved with Cottage Labs:


<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span6">
		<div class="well">
			<h2 class="cl_red_leader">Contractor</h2>

		<p>The easiest way to become involved with Cottage Labs is to work with us as a contractor. Contractors bid for work on specific projects on an ad-hoc basis, and are not expected to be involved in the company beyond being sub-contracted to carry out specific tasks. We work with contractors in a number of different areas, from developers to graphic designers. </p>
