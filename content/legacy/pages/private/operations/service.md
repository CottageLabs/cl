Here are our service tiers - <strong>the higher the tier, the more of our time you'll be buying for keeping your service up and running</strong>. The more effort we can put in, the more we can do for you
in terms of being available to deal with problems, recover from backups, and so on. <strong>Ultimately, we will help you get the best hosting arrangement by talking through your needs and making sure enough effort is dedicated to cover them.</strong>

## What is it?

It's somewhere to have your software applications up and running, and looked after. 
We take the code of your app, we run it on our servers, we run all our monitoring 
kit on it, and we ensure that there is virtually no downtime for your users.

We maintain a 24/7 watch on all hardware and software running in the cottage, and 
we deal with incidents as soon as they occur. We also respond very fast to your 
email enquiries during standard UK office hours, and actually at most other times 
of day (and night) as well. We also make daily backups of all the application data and configurations, and 
retain them for a time suitable to your service tier level, so we can recover the state of 
your service as required.

Our tiered service levels, detailed above, indicate how quickly we will respond to problems (and of course, the hardware scales up with the tiers). We always 
try to respond as fast as possible, but applications on higher tiers receive priority. Higher tiers also receive 
longer retention periods - if your application is serious and critical to your business, we recommend choosing a higher 
tier for greater peace of mind. That way we can service it to the level it really needs.


## What's the deal?

A rolling monthly service provision, based on payment of one of the above-listed prices (plus UK VAT if your business is in the UK). To be paid monthly 
or annually, with the option of ending with one month notice (if paid annually, unused months will be refunded).

What we do is run sufficient infrastructure to keep all the services we are looking after up and running. About 10% of the cost goes on hardware, another 10% on backups and supporting services (and things like SSL certificates if your application requires them), and the remaining 80% on paying for the time of the people at CL supporting your service for you. 
There is not a specific hardware price because we do not necessarily allocate machines solely to one service - in some cases, such as with datatbases and indexes, it is more efficient and 
robust to put the data in a cluster of machines that we use to serve mutliple applications.

Every application is provisioned with hardware suitable to ensure it can keep running smoothly. 
A good estimate is that for 10% of every Â£200 we are paid (that's Â£20) we use a dual core virtual machine with 2GB memory - we spend more money either on increasing the power of one machine, 
or on adding more machines to support an application, depending on what best suits the profile of the application being supported.

If you experience massive growth and running your app becomes too expensive 
for us (say because your user base gets ten times larger) we'll talk to you 
about increasing the cost appropriately to ensure stability.


## What is it not?

It's not customer service. We don't respond to any issues that your users have, 
unless those issues are technical ones to do with how the system is running. So, 
for example, if your users have trouble remembering their password or they forget 
how to do some admin task, it is up to you to have a way to help them. But if they
are experiencing unusual extremely slow pages loading, we could help you investigate.

It's not development. We will not develop any new features as part of this deal. 
If you would like that, we will work with you at our normal dev rates.
Either way we can roll out any upgrades to your software in the cottage with no downtime 
for your users.

It's not provision of a machine that you can access, and it's not running an 
app that your technical staff can tweak. We run the machines, we run the software 
for you, and your users can access it via whatever user/admin interfaces the 
software is designed to provide.

We ARE more expensive than hiring your own hardware directly - because we're offering a supported sysadmin service, 
not just machines. If what you're looking for is just some bare metal, we'd recommend Amazon or Digital Ocean, that's who 
we use.

## How to get going

If your app runs on software developed by us, it's seamless. Just talk to us to 
agree hosting, and we'll start running your app for you.

If your software is your own, or was made by someone else, we will probably still 
host it for you. We'll need to have access to the software so that we can assess 
it, and we will host it on our usual package if we can. If not, we'd be happy 
to talk more about alternate arrangements to meet your requirements.


## Is there a more expensive option?

Yes! If you think you'd like us to run your stuff but you reckon it is beyond 
what we can manage on this deal, we will gladly work with you to agree a higher 
spec at an acceptable price. We'll even help you analyse your apps if you're not 
sure how much oomph you need.

Also, if we're running your app for you and it turns out to be too expensive for us to 
run within our usual offering, we'll discuss with you to increase the price - NOTE though 
that we never tie you in to using us in any way; all the software will always be available 
to you, and we will provide you with copies of backups on request. So if you feel 


## What if I want out?

If at any point you want to end your arrangement with us, you can. We'll give 
you copies of your software in the state it is running in, and we'll give you 
copies of the last database and other data backups. Once you let us know you are
sure, we will delete everything of yours from the cottage, and we will stop 
expecting payment from you. If you had already paid us for months you did not use, 
we'll refund you for the time unused after all your stuff has been deleted from 
our systems.


## Is it worth it?

We think so. When comparing Â£12k per year to, say, Â£70k per year to have your 
own sysadmin person with a pension and an office and holidays and hardware and so on, it seems like a good deal.

The people we're already running stuff for (like the <a href="http://doaj.org">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>
for <a href="http://is4oa.org/">Inftrastructure Services for Open Access (IS4OA)</a>, and <a href="http://howopenisit.org/">OpenArticleGauge</a> for 
<a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>) are very happy with our service and we have had no complaints.

And if you don't think it's worth it, you're free to try to convince us why not! We'll have a negotiation :)

Or do it yourself! We'll not lock you in at any point, whether to our service, our software, or our storage of your data.

## Other bits and bobs

Of course we offer our usual software development services, and these can complement our sysadmin packages at various points. 

For example if a software application that we are running for you encounters unforeseen errors that are not related to the running of the app itself, we can provide in-depth investigation, diagnosis, and bug fixing support at our standard day rate of Â£500 + VAT. It is possible to contract us to work on such errors as they arise, and for each problem an initial investigation and price estimate is provided before work begins, and no further work would be carried out without express permission of the customer upon discussion of any estimated cost alterations. We also offer discounted day rates for longer regular commitments. For example we would provide a set amount of software expertise - such as one day per week - for use at a customers discretion on a long term basis of three months or more.

We can also provide software analysis and efficiency / maintainability improvements such as moving software stacks into version control systems, to fixing efficiency issues in code that works but that could be better, to complete re-writes for various purposes including translation to alternative programming languages. We can also do work such as data import/export from data storage systems, and transformation of legacy data from one format to another.

Some degree of software refactoring work is sometimes required before we can provide application and supported hosting, particularly where the software to be hosted was not written by ourselves. Any such requirement will be discussed and negotiated before a longer contract is undertaken.

With all our packages we make every effort to ensure an application remans available 24/7/365. We implement round-the-clock monitoring with automated error alerts to our staff, and we try to ensure any errors are resolved as quickly as possible as soon as they arise. However, in the case where such errors occur outside typical UK office hours, we may not be able to provide feedback until office hours resume, and in some cases it would not be possible to repair an application outside of office hours if it is discovered that the error arises due to an issue that requires collaboration with a third party provider. The lengths to which we will go beyond office hours are laid out in our package options.

Our packages all include issue tracking. Should a non-critical issue arise with the running application that we are not aware of, it can be logged by the customer in our issue tracking system and we will investigate it during the next business day. We will then repair it quickly and at no extra cost if at all possible, however if the issue was caused by matters beyond our control such as an issue in the original codebase written by a third party or relating to a need for new rather than reparative development, then we will provide cost estimates to resolve the issue over and above the monthly costs. Note in particular that any issues that require development of new features are explicitly not covered by the supported hosting contract - as such, it remains appropriate to log them in the issue tracker, but they will be identified as requiring new development and an estimate for providing such development work will be discussed separately.

We do NOT provide user help desk services - e.g. for our customers or for the users of their systems we do not take calls pertaining to how to use the service. Our support services are purely those of managing applications themselves, ensuring they are up and running, and that they can be used by staff and users - but HOW they are used is not something we can help with. We can, however, analyse software packages whether written by ourselves or others and put together training materials on how to achieve the workflows required by our customers. We can then deliver these materials digitally or in hard copy for use in-house, or we can provide training sessions where the materials are used to guide hands on practical work with the software systems in question. This service is additional to our monthly package costs.
