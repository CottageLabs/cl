            <h1>Overview</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>About Artemis</h2>
        <p><br>Part of Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe, <a href="http://www.artemisip.com/">Artemis Intelligent
            Power</a> carries out research, development and technology licensing associated with its trademark Digital
            Displacement hydraulic power technology; along with other innovations in the control and transmission of
            fluid power. Through its long term development projects with market-leading industrial partners, the company
            has continued to grow and as a result needed to update its manufacturing process to meet global demand. The
            company had a purpose built manufacturing facility adjacent to its R&amp;D headquarters, however its
            existing parts database was inadequate for external facing production. </p>


    </div>

    <div class="span6">
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>Cottage Labs was commissioned to create a custom parts database to meet the organisation's changing
            manufacturing and R&amp;D needs. Existing products were priced for large scale manufacturers and lacked the
            required functionality and flexibility.
        <p>

        <h2>Our solution</h2>
        <p>Working closely with the team at Artemis, Cottage Labs created a bespoke relation-less database to track and
            manage parts within the company's workflow. The new database was designed to cope with complex history,
            assembly, testing and component data, and to give Artemis better control of their inventory. The database
            was built on entirely open source software components, which had been tried and tested by the wider
            developer community and are not subject to restrictions on future development or expensive proprietary
            license fees. Phase 1 was deployed within one month of initial requirement sign off. </p>

            <h1>Details</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>Project Outline</h2>

        <p>Artemis required </p>
        <p>Cottage Labs identified a series of steps to complete to achieve the project aims.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating new part record and assigning an ID.</li>
            <li>Creating new assembly record.</li>
            <li>Editing part and assembly record with further details at any time</li>
            <li>Identifying which assembly a part belonged to</li>
            <li>Search for part or assembly, by location, status, any value in a document.</li>
            <li>Automated local backup script.</li>
            <li>Operator and technical manual.</li>
            <li>Import data from old system.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>What was required for success?</h3>

        <p>The ability to accurately detail changes and account for the movement of items was limited in the existing
            database. Likewise the process for commercial production demanded the ability for greater granularity in
            tracking test data, part and assembly changes.</p>
        <p>Cottage Labs worked with Artemis to map out their production workflow and created a tailored solution that
            improved efficiency and matched the company's forward-looking goals.</p>

        <h2>Technical advantages</h2>

        <p>Cottage Labs has created a unique software stack, employing cutting edge Open Source code for data
            management. The key to the success of this software is based around two main components: Facetview and
            Bibserver, which provide unparalleled search, storage, and recovery of documents. </p>

        <p>Typically websites, CMS or databases are limited in teh ways that they can search and present information but
            by combining the latest software tools Cottage Labs has been able able to deliver a faster search
            experience.</p>

        <p>The front end of this software is based around the FacetView code. This tool is a <a
                href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin that lets you easily embed a faceted browse front end into
            any web page. This means that results can be filtered (faceted) to easily find the documents or records you
            need. It can interoperate with a variety of back-end search tools such as <a
                    href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">SOLR</a> or <a
                    href="http://elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a> (both of which are based on <a
                    href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>).</p>

        <p>BibServer is an open-source RESTful bibliographic data server. Cottage Labs has built on extensive experience
            designing and building software for library data management to repurpose this tool. In this software stack
            elements of bibserver code have been used to create a powerful tool to create and manage collections of
            records.</p>

        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <h4>Reliability</h4>
                    <p>Building on a range of well tested Open Source tools Cottage Labs created a bespoke solution that
                        included components that were tried and tested. Building on community efforts such as bibserver
                        and facetview helped to ensure that software bugs were non-critical and that data security was
                        maintained.</p>

                    <h4>Stability</h4>
                    <p>With an existing database that was nearing capacity the liability of failure was high. By moving
                        to new, scalable technology Artemis were able to provide for growth with a a stable data
                        environment.</p>

                    <h4>Accountability</h4>
                    <p>In comparison to proprietary or closed-source software the tools provided by Cottage Labs are
                        completely open and auditable. The entire code base is examinable for qualities such as
                        security, freedom from backdoors, adherence to standards and flexibility in the face of future
                        changes. </p>
