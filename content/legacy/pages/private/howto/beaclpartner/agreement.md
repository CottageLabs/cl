# Cottage Labs Partners Agreement

This document outlines the agreement between all Cottage Labs Partners. It supercedes and replaces all previous partnership agreements. All Cottage Labs partners must sign this agreement and behave in accordance with it at all times. Associates are also described within this document; they need not sign, but should also behave accordingly.


## What is Cottage Labs

Cottage Labs is a Limited Liability Partnership, registered in Scotland with the number SO303454. The purpose of the partnership is to provide software development, reporting and analysis services / consultancy. The target (but not exclusive) market is UK further and higher education / research institutions, and other entities in that environment such as libraries and museums. The default state of Cottage Labs to all work is one of "open" - software should be open source, reports should be publicly available, projects and their supporting information should be easily accessible. CL is used as an abbreviation for Cottage Labs, which is used as an abbreviation for Cottage Labs LLP.


## What does Cottage Labs do

Projects. Everything is a project. Projects provide services, not products. Typically an open source or creative commons product will be the result of the service delivered. Closed projects are not forbidden, but are not the norm and so must provide justification for such closure and accept the burden of ensuring such closure is maintained where necessary. So far, the services offered are software development, project management, software consultancy, report writing and editing, and supporting design.

Some projects are internal projects; these are the ones required to keep CL running. They tend not to have external customers / funders, but are first-class projects nonetheless, and require the same proposal approval, reporting and other project processes.


## What are Cottage Labs members, and what responsibilities do they have

Cottage Labs contains three sorts of member - associates, partners, and senior partners. Each of these member types have particular responsibilities.

### Associates

Cottage Labs associates are people or businesses that work regularly on Cottage Labs projects. Associates do not agree to the partnership agreement so have no real responsibilities, but are expected to behave as per the following:

* provide a short bio for inclusion on the CL /people page
* perform assigned tasks to the level expected of them by CL partners
* adhere to any rules set by any particular project they commit to work on
* monitor and respond in a timely fashion to any emails pertaining to CL work, whether this be on a CL email account that they may be provided, or to their own account
* inform partners, when asked, of their desire or otherwise to do work on a particular project, for which they will have first refusal
* must quote for work they desire to do on particular CL projects
* must invoice for work done upon delivery (or at other agreed billing point), and will be paid upon receipt of their invoice to CL, subject to sufficient funds having been received from the project funder (or at the discretion of the Senior Partners, from funds they control)
* must not abuse the privileges accorded to them by association with CL
* whilst associates cannot propose or lead projects, they are welcome to suggest projects to a partner for proposal

### Partners

Cottage Labs partners are officially part of the CL partnership, and have the following responsibilities/rights:

* must sign and adhere to the partnership agreement, and adhere to all supporting responsibilities mentioned herein - e.g. responsibilities of being project manager for a particular project
* propose actions / changes that CL should implement
* provide (or decide not to provide, after suitable consideration) a +1 to any vote required in Cottage Labs (+1 system described below)
* propose, lead and quality control some projects
* request for reimbursement of costs for attending an event on behalf of CL
* charge pre-agreed expenses onto particular projects they are working on
* suitably represent CL when attending events or working on projects in any CL capacity
* attend online partners meetings at least once a quarter
* attend at least once a year a partners meeting in person, at own expense (this will probably be in Europe)
* any partner not having any project work in a given quarter must re-affirm their intention to remain (just to check they are still engaged)
* whilst partners are free to work on projects outwith Cottage Labs, partners must make efforts to bring some new projects into CL; partners must not expect only to be assigned to projects
* whilst partners can contract for a fixed rate per deliverable on a particular project, partners must endeavour to work on projects as a committed partner for a percentage of profit after costs, wherever possible

Further information about how to propose and lead projects, how to perform project quality control, how partnership shares are calculated, and so on, are available in the Cottage Labs how-to documentation at http://cottagelabs.com/howto. Whilst the how-to documents are not static documents which partners must officially sign, all partners are expected to read and contribute to this documentation, and to apply them as appropriate to relevant tasks and situations. Any changes to the how-to documentation will be shared with all at Cottage Labs, and disputes may be raised via the +1 system as necessary. Failure to abide by the how-to documentation may trigger a proposal to remove a partner from the partnership.


### Senior Partners

Senior partners have all the responsibilities/rights of partners, plus some additional ones:

* whilst senior partners may not be full time, they must be capable of meeting all their responsibilities to CL regardless of any external commitments
* commit to doing all of their work through CL wherever possible (exceptional circumstances will require justification)
* request permission from other senior partners to do any work outwith CL
* take on a responsibility to deliver an internal CL project whenever required; it is possible for a senior partner to not be responsible for any internal CL project if there are already enough partners willing to maintain them, but where this is not the case, senior partners MUST take responsibility, whether or not funds are available to pay for the work
* engage with any senior partnership discussions as appropriate, and in particular to provide practical contributions to any veto discussions that may arise out of application of the +1 system (described below)


## How to obtain particular forms of CL membership

### How to become an associate

* have a quote accepted for work (and successfully deliver that work) on at least one CL project (although this does not in itself confer association)
* ask a partner to, or a partner chooses to, recommend a non-CL person or entity to be registered as a CL associate
* if this receives the required +1s via the usual method, the person becomes an associate

### How to become a partner

* successfully complete at least one deliverable to a CL project
* be an associate for a minimum of six months
* ask a partner to, or a partner chooses to, recommend an associate becomes a partner
* state a commitment to meet the responsibilities of being a partner
* if this receives the required +1s via the usual method, the person can become a partner
* sign the partnership agreement

### How to become a senior partner

* remain a partner for at least one year
* ask a partner to, or a partner chooses to, recommend a partner becomes a senior partner
* state a commitment to meet the responsibilities of being a senior partner
* get agreement from senior partners to become a senior partner


## How to dissolve particular forms of CL membership

### Associates

* an associate remains so until such time as proposed (and successfully +1d) no longer necessary by a CL partner
* an associate may also request to no longer be associated
* when no longer an associate, any details on the CL website and any CL accounts and access privileges will be removed
* being or ceasing to be an associate does not in itself bar a person from continuing to work on, or working on future, CL projects; nor does it absolve an assoicate of delivering any work quoted to a particular project

### Partners

* a partner may choose to cease to be a partner at any time
* any partner can propose that any partner be ejected from the partnership (requiring the usual +1s)
* where any partner has unexplainedly failed to carry out any partner, project leadership, or other responsibility inferred by being a partner, an automatic proposal to remove them from the partnership will be raised
* where any partner has been unexplainedly absent from partner meetings for more than one quarter, an automatic proposal to remove them from the partnership will be raised
* where any partner has had no payment or project commitments for two quarters, an automatic proposal to remove them from the partnership will be raised
* a partner who leaves will still receive payments at future quarterly reviews for any money incoming during that quarter for work the partner did prior to leaving
* a partner leaving has no intrinsic effect on any commitments to current projects - all responsibilities should be carried out until the end of those projects
* however any changes required for particular projects due to a partner leaving in particular circumstances can be negotiated as required when a partner needs to leave
* a partner who leaves loses all rights to +1, all access, accounts and privileges as soon as an agreed date on which to leave is reached


### Senior partners

* a senior partner may be removed by the same process as partners


## Making decisions - proposing actions or changes

### the +1 system

* all proposals for any decision, action, change, project must be added to the agenda of the next available weekly lab meeting, or next arranged partners meeting if the decisions affects only partners
* all proposals must be communicated via the "partners" and/or "all" mailing lists in addition to being raised at a meeting
* all proposals must receive two +1s, and at least one of them must be from a senior partner
* a period of up to one week should be waited before final decision is made, to ensure all relevant people have a chance to consider the proposal
* where a decision must be made faster than one week, senior partners can be requested to make it earlier but must still communicate all such intentions and any outcomes as soon as they arise
* provision of +1s must be documented in the meeting pad at which they occurred, or provided via CL email account, and in the case of projects listed in the project metadata
* all successful proposals must be communicated at the next appropriate meeting and via the "all" or "partners" mailing list
* partners may seek to deny a proposal only by successfully arguing to all but one partners that they should not give their +1
* any proposal being approved must be accepted by all partners, regardless of their personal disapproval, or inability to respond in time to the proposal
* the only possible action to block a successful proposal is a senior partner veto

### Senior partner veto

* any senior partner may request a veto of any successful proposal
* by majority decision, the senior partners may choose to uphold a veto request against any successful proposal
* this should be considered a last resort, and any such decision must be fully discussed with all partners before being finalised, and alternatives sought
* the outcome of all such veto considerations must be documented on the partners meeting pad, whether implemented or not
* if there are only two senior partners at the time a veto is raised and they cannot agree, then whichever senior partner can attain majority agreement of all partners wins
* if still no majority agreement can be reached, then negotiations to reach an agreement via any means possible must ensue
* if no agreement of any form can be reached, the partnership must be dissolved
