						<h1 style="font-size:80px;text-align:right">EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES POLICY</h1>
					</div>

					<p style="text-align:justify;">
						We are committed to the achievement of equal opportunities. We recognise and accept our responsibilities under the law. We believe discrimination, either direct or indirect as defined in law, is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it. In the same way, victimisation, as defined in law, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. However, our policy is not limited to the minimum standards imposed by the law. We are committed to achieve best practice in the area of equal opportunities.</p>

					<p>Everyone who is or who seeks to be a member of staff of the Partnership is entitled to receive equality of opportunity and treatment that is appropriate and fair irrespective of:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>age</li>
							<li>colour</li>
							<li>disablement</li>
							<li>marital status</li>
							<li>race/ethnicity</li>
							<li>religion</li>
							<li>sex</li>
							<li>gender</li>
							<li>employment status</li>
							<li>sexual orientation</li>
							<li>nationality</li>
							<li>caring responsibility</li>
							<li>socio-economic status</li>
							<li>other unjustifiable factors</li>
						</ul>

					<p>This list is not exhaustive</p>
					<p>We will be proactive in all matters relating to equality of opportunity and diversity. We recognise that the behaviours through which diversity is evident must be consistent with the values that underpin this policy document. Additionally, we recognise that despite our best intentions circumstances may arise where we fail to provide an appropriate and professional service to people, consistent with the aims of this policy. We are committed to take action in such circumstances.</p>
					<p>As an employer we will seek to ensure equality of opportunity and treatment in the recruitment, selection, retention, training and promotion of staff at all levels, and the adoption of flexible patterns of working. To this end we will develop personnel policies and practices that will demonstrate and further our commitment to Equal Opportunities. Selection criteria and procedures will be designed, and outcomes monitored and reviewed, to ensure that staff are recruited and selected on the basis of their assessed merits and abilities when compared with the needs of the Partnership. We will take care to ensure that applicants or potential applicants are not discouraged or disadvantaged by the adoption of any conditions or criteria, which cannot be justified in terms of specific job requirements. Additionally we will seek to attract, encourage and welcome applications from a wide range of people to enhance the diversity of our staff.</p>
