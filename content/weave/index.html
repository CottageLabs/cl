					<h2>Acuity Commodities</h2>
					<p>Acuity offers market reports on the global sulphur and sulphuric acid markets, and as such are tracking many different data points, including production, consumption, and shipping volumes, as well as price data across the globe.</p>

					<p>We worked with Acuity to develop practices within the organisation for managing their complex data such that it is easy for them to produce reports in a variety of contexts for the different parts of the market they service.  We then went on to develop interactive map visualisations on which their data can be overlayed, supporting them in client presentations, and allowing their data to be served via login-protected pages on their website.</p>

					<p>The data visualisations for Acuity are stand-alone, they have been deployed entirely within their WordPress CMS, so no external service is required, and they draw their data directly from spreadsheets maintained by the team.</p>

					<h2>Jisc</h2>
					<p>Jisc provide digital solutions for UK education and research, and among those solutions are tools for monitoring and supporting Open Access publication by academics.</p>

					<p>We worked with Jisc to create a national aggregation of data relating to research publications and publication cost.  The aggregation supports a contribution and search API, and is integrated with other Jisc systems.  It also presents four distinct visual reports for different stakeholders, allowing users to refine the parameters of their reports, seeing graphs and supporting information update in real-time as they explore their data.  The graphical data is also available to the user in tabular form, and can be downloaded directly as a spreadsheet on demand.</p>

					<p>The aggregation uses the full Weave technology stack in providing both back-end storage and data management, an API, and multiple visualisations, along with authentication and user account management.  It is installed entirely on Jisc's own server infrastructure.</p>

					<h2>World Nuclear Association</h2>
					<p>WNA is a trade body representing companies with a stake in the nuclear industry.  As part of their commitment to be a canonical source of reliable information, they maintain a database of nuclear reactors, their construction and operation history, and their performance data.</p>

					<p>We worked with WNA to help them develop a process to manage the integration of data maintained by their experts with data sourced via external services into a single dataset which can be used for presenting data to their members and the general public.  We created an ingest pipeline for several spreadsheets, allowing a review stage before final publication.  We also created two key views on the data: the first to allow search and browse of their reactor catalogue, and the second to allow a detailed view of a single reactor, mixing geographical information with time-series charts to display operational histories.</p>

					<p>The WNA system uses the full Weave technology stack, and is installed on their in-house server infrastructure.  There is an admin back-end used only by staff, and the visualisations are embedded into their website, which is a Kentico CMS.</p>

					<p>The Reactor Database is publicly accessible <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/reactor-database.aspx">here</a></p>
