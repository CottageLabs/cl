This is the Cottage Labs website

It includes submodules, so after cloning you should:

cd bar

git submodule update --init

(if it fails, just go into cl/static/vendor and yank out facetview and jtedit, 
then clone them directly instead)

http://github.com/CottageLabs/jtedit

This repo is also used to track sysadmin issues. see the issue tracker for things tagged "admin"
