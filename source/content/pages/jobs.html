                        including data repositories and infrastructure to support open access publishing. Much of our
                        code is open source and we maintain links to the open data community worldwide. Our clients have
                        included the Universities of Stanford, Oxford, and Edinburgh, as well as organisations such as
                        Crossref, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and the World Nuclear Association. Projects run
                        from a few months to years and usually involve development, customisation, and the deployment of
                        data management and analysis platforms.</p>
