                            before looking to contribute to a variety of projects for clients all over the world. Key
                            responsibilities include:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Contributing high quality code, tests, and documentation to projects</li>
                            <li>Collaborating with project team members - discussing approaches to new features,
                                reviewing pull requests, pair programming where applicable etc.

                                with queries and technical questions relating to projects
                            </li>
                            <li>Keeping up-to-date with best practice and promising new technologies</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>How we work</h3>
                        <p>The whole team at Cottage Labs has always worked remotely. We regularly collaborate on
                            projects by pairing over zoom and we have an active Slack workspace where support is
                            available. So do people we work with; you may be hopping between channels talking to various
                            interesting people throughout the day.</p>

                        <p>We meet up in person from time to time (expenses will be covered) and have a weekly catch-up
                            during work hours to keep in touch. We’re also open to flexible working arrangements.</p>

                        <h3>Our stack</h3>
                        <p>As we have some ongoing work and prospects involving the Samvera Hyrax repository software,

                            long-term projects in numerous programming languages, so any additional languages and
                            interests would benefit us. We also require knowledge of version control.</p>

                        <p>Demonstrated experience in digital library applications or related application domains would
                            be a bonus. </p>
