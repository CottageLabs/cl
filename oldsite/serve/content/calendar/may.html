                        <p>This month sees quite a few of us decamp to Berlin for <a href="http://csvconf.com/">CSVConf</a>, a community conference for people working with data in all its forms.</p>

						<p>Since working with data is something we do a lot of, we're going to present on some work we've been doing to bring cost-effective data visualisation capabilities to our clients, by using spreadsheets to replace expensive back-end admin areas in bespoke software.</p>

						<p>You can see the presentation we're going to give <a href="/weave/csvconf">here</a></p>

						<p>If you're not already working with us on that kind of project, but it sounds interesting, why not <a href="mailto:us@cottagelabs.com">drop us an email</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cottagelabs">tweet us</a>, and we can tell you more!</p>

						<p>And maybe we'll see some of you in Berlin?</p>
