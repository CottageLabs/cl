    <p>Cottage Labs are working with JISC to create a report on the future of mobile technology for Higher Education. Entitled "Mobile Futures," the report is aimed at senior managers within Higher Education Institutions, and will provide an overview of how mobile technology is changing the landscape in which they operate, drawing on examples both from within and outwith the UK HE sector. Covering areas which are of interest to a senior management audience, including student experience (both from a learning and teaching and integration perspective), strategy, and efficiency, the report will discuss the ways in which the sector could benefit from its own research, as well as from initiatives that are happening outside HE. The aim of the report is to stimulate discussion, provide insight and encourage collaboration across the sector.</p>
