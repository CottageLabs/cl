**Project Summary**

Cottage Labs is working with <a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk">DevCSI </a>based at the <a href="http://isc.ukoln.ac.uk/">Innovation Support Centre, UKOLN</a> to analyze and prepare cost findings on the impact of the DevCSI organised Dev8D conference from 2009 to 2012.

We worked with attendance data from various years along with estimates provided by UKOLN to estimate the value of savings associated with Dev8D's unique conference experience.
