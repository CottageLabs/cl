><p class="c4"><span>Choosing the right systems to manage information in your library is a major task and the first step is to ensure you ask the right questions. This guide focuses on the decision process in selecting Discovery Layer services for your library. It is part of a larger </span><span class="c8"><a class="c16" href="http://foss4lib.org/decision-support/software-selection">Software Selection Methodology toolkit</a></span><span>&nbsp;for those involved in implementing Library systems. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c21 c4"><span></span></p><h2 class="c4"><a name="h.7iw58qlnprqn"></a><span>What is a Discovery Layer?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Discovery Layers are a relatively new software component for libraries that provide a search interface for users to find information held in the library&rsquo;s catalogue and beyond. Typically, a Discovery Layer is based on an enterprise search platform that can interact with a metadata index and will normally include additional features that allow your library to customize the search results. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>FOSS Discovery Layer software now provides a strong alternative to early commercial products such as Aquabrowser, Primo or Encore [</span><span class="c37">1</span><span>]. Open Source search platforms, such as Apache Solr, are used widely however different configurations will generally have varying degrees of proprietary elements. </span></p><p class="c21 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>As a new concept, Discovery Layer systems are still evolving and there is no hard and fast definition of what constitutes an idealized system. They first developed as a direct result of the &lsquo;decoupling&rsquo; of catalogue search and browse functionality from the integrated library management system (ILS) stack. The primary function is a user interface that allows patrons to navigate and find information. This generally sits atop harvested metadata such as catalogue recor
ds from local and/ or remote databases.</span></p><p class="c21 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>The Discovery Layer interface will generally provide a unified view across resources such as local archival management systems, institutional repositories or the the catalogue component of a library management system. Some will even crawl local websites. Harvested data is indexed and presented to the end user in a single set of results. </span></p><p class="c4"><img height="306" src="images/image01.png" width="587"></p><p class="c4"><span>Most systems lie somewhere between a traditional ILS catalogue search and web search engine. In general they are more structured than a search engine. a refined version of search and discovery options available on e-commerce sites such as Amazon or eBay. There will be an expectation that data underpinning the service is richer and tailored for academic or local user group needs. </span></p><p class="c21 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Discovery layer products are usually deployed alongside or as an outright replacement to a traditional online public access catalogue (OPAC). They can be seen as a response of sorts to the allegation that traditional online catalogue interfaces do not reflect the modern day search engine experience that a web native generation of users expect. [</span><span class="c37">2</span><span>] </span></p><p class="c21 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>One key factor for a Discovery Layer is that it can index data that lies outside the library&rsquo;s immediate catalogue - e.g web based content stored remotely, metadata for copyrighted works not in the library catalogue, or content stored in other libraries. The Discovery Layer can therefore cover a far greater scope than a simple search of the library catalogue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.nfqxo26ubuf0"></a><span>Why is a Discovery Layer important?</span></h2><p class="c3"
><span>The Discovery Layer is a vital consideration for any library as in many cases it is what clients will see as the face of the library when they navigate for information. In effect it is the interface that people will interact with to find information. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>As such the Discovery Layer needs to reflect the core aims of the library in the eyes of the user and provide a perspective on the collection, preservation, organization, and dissemination activities that take place within the library. For more information see the section of this guide about </span><span class="c8"><a class="c16" href="#id.15ix0t3zpza6">brand</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The main aim is to connect users to the information they need as effortlessly as possible and as such a badly operating Discovery Layer can severely damage reputation and potentially even funding. If users find the Discovery Layer difficult or slow to use it is likely to negatively impact their perception of the Library. If they are not able to find the information they want however &nbsp;then it is likely that they will seek other services or stop using the library completely in future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h1 class="c3 c25"><a name="h.ed1fnbfzavar"></a></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c3 c25"><a name="h.59w19q9mxylj"></a></h1><h1 class="c3"><a name="h.2qm8uxoy9jru"></a><span>What is the right Discovery Layer solution for you?</span></h1><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Before reading this section you may want to consult the general sections about </span><span class="c8"><a class="c16" href="http://foss4lib.org/open-source-selection/software-selection-process/project-startup/identify-timelines-and-stakeholders">project start-up </a></span><span>or </span><span class="c8"><a class="c16"

In many cases users search, not to access the content itself but, to make themselves aware of what is out there. In response to this most Discovery Layer software provides users with the ability to search a curated list of content that extends beyond the library but is more refined than the open web.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>To do this the software works around the concept of a Central Index, essentially a list of metadata pulled from a variety of sources. The exact sources will depend on the choices of your library and to a large extent a successful Discovery Layer system will depend on library staff making intelligent choices that match users needs.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><img height="392" src="images/image00.jpg" width="513"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c44"></span></p><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.r7ywff93yfp8"></a><span>Web Scale Discovery (WSD) services</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>As Discovery layers have evolved there has been a trend to include metadata from beyond the libraries traditional sources. As a result Web Scale Discovery (WSD) Services have developed to provide ready made databases of metadata for libraries to search across. These services harvest d
ata and full text from online resource publishers into a single index that can be &lsquo;scoped&rsquo; to represent library holdings. Local metadata from catalogues and repositories can also be harvested into the index. Assuming the relevant data is available and correctly harvested; such an approach provides a single index for libraries&rsquo; physical and online collections. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>WSD Services are generally provided by commercial suppliers. Some implementations utilise a local discovery layer and a WSD service, using a combination of the two to best meet the needs of local users. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>When considering which system(s) to implement it is important to differentiate between the Discovery Layer &nbsp;user interface component and the underlying central index or WSD. Popular FOSS software, such as VuFind and Blacklight, essentially provides an interface that can be coupled with a variety of different WSD services. The VuFind interface layer contains a specific module to connect to the Summon WSD index. Many commercial systems in comparison provide a user interface component that is specifically designed to work with that vendors own WSD service. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>It is important to consider how any system you choose will inter-operate with other components and what scope there is for change in future. Increasingly commercial WSD services are available via API making it possible for FOSS Discovery layer software to search across various services.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You should also consider specific examples of users at your library as not everyone will need to use the system in the same way. A WSD will not necessarily replace databases for all users. In an academic environment, for example, a WSD service may be suited for undergraduate research needs but graduate student may r
ely on a specialist database</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Whilst Webscale Discovery undoubtedly has an important role to play for many libraries, many libraries will choose not to deploy a web scale index or use one alongside a local index. Regardless, the actual presentation of results in a standalone discovery layer will be important to a library. Selecting a Discovery Solution will require careful consideration of the various options available, framed against an enlightened perception of local user requirements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c26">Federated search </span></p><p class="c3"><span>In some cases there are distinct advantages in combining search and indexing functionality across various organizations. Federated search provides a strategy where data </span><span>is held over multiple connected systems, providing replication and other services to each other (e.g. a search operation can be executed across the whole federation).</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><img height="279" src="images/image04.jpg" width="399"></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>A federated system can provide strengths and weakness:</span></p><a href="#" name="b93a90c5776cc3442f13242fa99441398b3e0c56"></a><a href="#" name="0"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c27"><tbody><tr><td class="c34"><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c13 c26 c50">Strengths</span></p></td><td class="c47 c48"><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c13 c26 c47">Weaknesses</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c38"><ol class="c9" start="1"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c1">No single point of failure</span></li><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c1">Organisations can have local control</span></li><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c1">Individual nodes can

g a filter based on the year articles were published or the name of authors. This can be a very powerful tool for users and provides much more detailed search than a search engine as it allows users to interrogate the structure of the data. However it also relies on having access to the same metadata from different sources.

This may include title, creator, producer and publication date, as well as subject information. It might also include location in a library (including loan status), or a link to a resource. If the resource is behind a pay-wall, the system should work with any local authentication mechanism to enable access. </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="4"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Transparency </span><span>- Its important for users to understand why results are displayed against their search terms. &nbsp;Discovery layers should indicate what in indexed metadata or full-text has been matched and display these terms and potentially the frequency matched.

Some commercial produces do not fully disclose the nature of the ranking algorithms Open Source systems present an opportunity here, however this is somewhat mitigated by the complexity and ongoing cost of maintaining customised algorithms.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="5"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Meaningful exposure of different content sources and types</span><span>&nbsp;- Library discovery layers, like search engines link to descriptions of physical items, full text online, images, citations and entries in reference works. If presented badly, this can ensure a confusing experience. Some present results from different resources in tabs and columns, others use facets and icons to denote format and nature of material. Visual interpretation can assist users in meaningfully navigating a complex set of results. </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="1"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Browse functionality - </span><span>Some discovery services have attempted to replicate the function of older OPAC interfaces, the ability to navigate records by a subject heading or classification scheme. This can prove problematic without extensive customisation, especially where complex and in-house schemes are used. </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13">Result manipulation</span></p><ol class="c9" start="1"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Sorting</span><span>&nbsp;- Whilst relevancy ranking meets many requirements, some library users will like to browse results by publication date or even by author name</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="2"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Folders/lists </span><span>- Many researchers like to store citations and records for later use, or for export to citation management software. So
me Discovery layers allow users to save results in lists or nested folders. This is a useful feature, but libraries may prefer to divert users to dedicated reference and citation management software for this kind of activity</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="3"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">T</span><span class="c13">agging</span><span>&nbsp;- tagging mechanisms were initially seen as a key part of a discovery layer. In practice, they require a substantial commitment from users to provide and maintain a useful corpus of information . Aggregations of tags for bibliographic works exist in other places on the web, notably the LibraryThing social network. Many discovery layers allow the import of tags from these services to enhance and support subject entries in catalogue records. Using pre built tag collections is a better way to utilise the concept of tagging.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="4"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Exporting citations </span><span>- Basic export of citation data to a citation management tool such as Endnote or Refworks is a staple function of a library discovery service. Bibtex and RIS formats are predominantly the most popular export formats. Text based export of data in popular citation styles such a Chicago, Harvard or MLA for direct copying and pasting into a written work is also a useful function.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c24"></span></p><h3 class="c3"><a name="h.jgqby382rf9"></a><span>Full record / object display </span></h3><p class="c3"><span>Library catalogues have traditionally presented a full page view for a catalogue record. Discovery services have tended to duplicate this, although many try to provide the necessary information to locate the book to the user in the search results. In this sense, its usefulness has been somewhat diminished. &nbsp;There are still scenarios where they are useful, especially for libraries with special
 collections, whereby large complex catalogue records with notes and annotations can be displayed in their entirety. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="1"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Fulfillment and availability</span><span>&nbsp;- As with search results, full record displays should contain necessary information on on how obtain a physical item and appropriate links to online resources </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="2"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Other information on the resource</span><span>&nbsp;- In the networked environment, Libraries are no longer the sole sources of descriptive information on resources. Web sites such LibraryThing hold additional information on a work, Wikipedia contains biographical information,, Amazon provides reviews of a work. Mechanisms exist in discovery services to easily link out to these services, but also to draw in information via API&rsquo;s. As an example the VuFind Discovery Layer can pull in reviews from Amazon. Some commercial vendors, such as Syndetics Solutions, provide additional reviews, summaries and first chapter previews for works </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="3"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Permanence - </span><span>&nbsp;A full record page should have some level of permanency. Users should be able to link to it using a persistent URL. Some discovery layers such as VuFind have taken this a stage further, with the option to publish sitemaps of record level URLS for external search engines such as Google to crawl</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="4"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Social media interaction</span><span>&nbsp;- As with tagging, many libraries like to offer integration to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, allowing users to quickly share record information with others in their own networks. Whilst of peripheral use, this is a u
biquitous function of website. </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="5"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Recommendation services - </span><span>The success of large &lsquo;long-tail&rsquo; retail such as Amazon can be in part attributed to the recommendation services built around them. The ability to expose material potentially relevant or useful to a user based on the activities of others is a natural fit for library activity. Such services are slowly beginning to emerge, based upon aggregations of anonymous usage data. </span></li></ol><h3 class="c3 c49"><a name="h.3wnk493dszk2"></a></h3><h3 class="c3"><a name="h.t2byc3mm7yk2"></a><span>User interaction</span></h3><ol class="c9" start="1"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Library a</span><span class="c13">ccount</span><span>&nbsp;- Some discovery layers can interact with integrated library systems (ILS) to provide account services found in OPAC software, including information on items on loan, renewals etc. Such functionality is usually dependent upon APIs provided by the underyling ILS. Understanding what your ILS can provide and what a Discovery Layer can interact with is the key consideration. Open Source products may have this functionality delivered by other users of an ILS. The ability to place holds and recalls onitems in the discovery interface can also be achieved using APIs. Modern ILS should have a number of APIS to support resource fullfillment</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="2"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Other interaction with content - </span><span>Visual information and cues can be important in differentiating your Discovery Layer environment. Having material such as high quality images of &nbsp;book jackets, interactive content or external visual context for an entry can help users interact. There are a variety of different additions which can potentially be added at the Discovery Layer level which to enrich results.
 These can either be cosmetic or metadata driven. </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.453c4xh4fztb"></a><h3 class="c3"><a name="h.ex1no02bqgt1"></a><span>Interface</span><span>&nbsp;considerations</span></h3><ol class="c9" start="1"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">APIs -</span><span>&nbsp;Discovery layers are part of a paradigm the also recognises that one single interface may not meet the needs of all users. To this end, Application Programe Interfaces (</span><span>APIs) are an increasingly important aspect of any discovery service. Using API&rsquo;s, developers can present information for a disocvery layer index in another application or website, such as the parent institutions wider search engine or a mobile application. If this use case is likey </span></li></ol><ol class="c43" start="1"><li class="c39 c3"><span>Is the API used by the Discovery layer itself or an afterthought?</span></li><li class="c39 c3"><span>How well documented is it?</span></li><li class="c39 c3"><span>How often does its usage change</span></li><li class="c39 c3"><span>Is it being heavily utilised by others?</span></li><li class="c3 c39"><span>Is it based around an established standard (SRU / Atom)?</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c13"></span></p><ol class="c9" start="2"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Templates and UI customisation</span><span>&nbsp;- Many libraries will want to customise their discovery portal to meet institutional branding requirements, to make it appear as &lsquo;part of the website&rsquo;. Discovery layers often utilise templates, software mechanisms to allow web designers to work on complex functionality without the need to use a full programming language. These may be a proprietary mechanism, or make use of established methods and technologies such as XSLT, PHP or another web scripting language. As well as access to templates, any mechanism to carry changes made forward through a vers
ion upgrade should be considered. </span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ol class="c9" start="3"><li class="c7 c3"><span class="c13">Mobile access</span><span>&nbsp;- Mobile and tablet access is increasingly important. A Discovery layer should understand the device a user is accessing it with and provide an appropriate interface, preferably utilising the best aspects of the device. It is advisable to use Responsive Web Design (RWD) &nbsp;[</span><span class="c37">3</span><span>] techniques which uses CSS3 or similar to </span><span class="c6">adapt the layout to the viewing environment, and use flexible images. </span><span>An option to access the full &lsquo;desktop&rsquo; version of the site should also be available, especially if the layer only presents a subset of features in a mobile interface</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h3 class="c3"><a name="h.7h0avm5hzrt1"></a><span>S</span><span>ources of metadata </span></h3><p class="c3"><span>A discovery layer should be able to interact with any structured data given to it. Most support binary MArc21 &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo;, sometimes via a conversion to XML. Other XML based Library standards, such as Dublin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) may be supported in a similar fashion. Other standards, or simple XML provided by a data source may require customisation of import routines to be successfully indexed. Discovery layers can support direct imports of data, or utilise harvesting mechanisms such as the </span><span>Open Archives Initiative - Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</span><span>&nbsp;(OAI-PMH), often used by digital repository software. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h2 class="c2"><a name="h.4p8bjgs2aruj"></a></h2><a href="#" name="id.15ix0t3zpza6"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.p4trsoynsols"></a><span>Brand</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>As the primary interface for many library users the Discovery Layer system you choose can have a direct impact on
 your Library&rsquo;s brand or reputation. As well as considering the functionality and performance of any system from a purely technical perspective it is important to consider users expectations and how they will transition. The way that a patron facing system is perceived can in many cases be far more important than the technical specifications. From the earliest stages, ensure that you engage all the stakeholders within your organization that may be concerned with your institutions brand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Consider the features that are likely to be most important to the patrons at your library. Is completeness of results more important than the speed at which they are returned? Are patrons likely to face issues if the service goes down in periods of high demand? Will users be familiar with added functionality and if not how will they become aware of it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Firstly identify those areas where failure or lack of responsiveness are likely to cause negative perceptions from users. It is worth considering the user experience that your patrons will be familiar with. If the Discovery layer system you implement is significantly worse - slower, unreliable, etc- than other search tools that your patrons use then they will tend to perceive this negatively in relation to your library&rsquo;s brand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Beyond the library there is now an ever increasing pool of </span><span>information </span><span>providers for patrons to use when searching for information so the brand competition from the very first interaction can be important. If users feel that the tools provided by a Discovery Layer system are inadequate or antiquated they will tend to gravitate toward other destinations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Once you have identified any risk areas you should consider in what ways a syste
m can improve your brand. From the users perspective a Discovery Layer often blurs the distinctions between where different information resides, making the repositories and stores of information somewhat opaque. In terms of brand this can provide opportunities. Many users may be accustomed to searching multiple interfaces and making choices based on aesthetics or perceptions rather than knowledge of the source of results and for this reason brand plays an important part in fostering trust between information provider and user.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>As an interface system for your library&rsquo;s brand it is important to &nbsp;think about how the resources you offer through a Discovery Layer system support your strategic mission and enhance your brand. Specifically for most libraries this will likely entail developing your reputation as a source of objective source material in contrast to informal information on the wider web.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>For more information on developing a Discovery Layer system to support your brand see the section on </span><span class="c8"><a class="c16" href="#id.453c4xh4fztb">Interface considerations</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c20"></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.oju6ldgibe4w"></a><span>Community and Ecosystem </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>When considering Open Source solutions one of the key strengths is the community that drives new development and supports existing code bases. &nbsp;While this community can be a very powerful way to respond rapidly to demand from users and develop new features it will vary greatly for each piece of software. As a result community uptake, growth rate, response and support can be very different for different systems. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>For more information about about the implications of Open Source communities to library systems

A strongly supported piece of software will generally see frequent and numerous commits as people contribute to improving the code. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>In the example below it can be seen that at the time of writing Vufind receives nearly double the number of commits (code updates) as Blacklight. While this does not prove that the code is better, or indeed that there is a stronger community supporting the software, it does suggest that there is a more active update schedule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Try to find out as much as possible about the community supporting a piece of software either from forums, peers or the people who write the software (commiters). In most cases they will be happy to help and provide information about what sort of support is available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><img height="314" src="images/image05.jpg" width="543"></p><p class="c3 c17"><span class="c14 c29">source: ohloh.net</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><img height="314" src="images/image02.jpg" width="549"></p><p class="c3 c17"><span class="c14 c29">source: ohloh.net</span></p><p class="c0 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>A strong community can be particularly useful when integrating with wider library or institutional systems

For any Discovery Layer system it is worth considering customization as a significant and ongoing costs. Whether you are working with developers within your library or outsourcing it is worth going beyond the &lsquo;off-the-shelf&rsquo; code to create a solution suited to your library&rsquo;s unique characteristics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You should also consider the implementation of a Discovery Layer in the wider context of your institutions IT systems.
