<h1>Researcher Identifiers</h1>
<p>The need for a researcher identifier has been widely debated. Cottage Labs were commissioned to write two complementary reports: one detailing the technical aspects of implementing an identifier and profile system for researchers, and the other providing an overview of sources of data relevant to the task of creating those profiles for academic researchers in the UK.  A researcher profile offers many inherent benefits at both the individual, institutional and national level and these reports highlights some of the salient systems in use.</p>

<p>Different people mean different things when they talk about an identifier. An identifier is purely some
value (e.g. a string, number, URI, sequence of bytes...) that uniquely identifies an entity. When
discussing researcher identifiers the topics of author profiles, authentication and authorisation
almost inevitably come up. It is important to note that while a standard identifier system may help the
development of profiles and authentication and authorisation tools, these functions do not need to be
part of the identifier system. That said, in order to enable identifier discovery, it is likely that at least
some "profile data" would need to be stored by the identifier system - including name(s), date of birth,
past and present institutional affiliations.</p>

<p>At present the concept of a researcher profile is ill-defined and this report aims to go some way
towards answering the question of what constitutes such a system. It includes an overview of data
sources, listing the main systems that hold data about researchers in the UK, and detailed case
studies of eight illustrative data sources.</p>

<p>There are significant privacy and trust issues associated with making personal information available
via a profile and this report aims to highlight some of the key concerns in relation to the sources of
data identified. In particular, any system that deals with private personal information will have potential
legal implications.</p>
