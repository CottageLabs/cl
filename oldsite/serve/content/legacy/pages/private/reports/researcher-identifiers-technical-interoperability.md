The need for a researcher identifier has been widely debated. This report discusses some of the
technical aspects of implementing an identifier and profile system for researchers. This report is a
companion piece to the report titled: 'Researcher Identifiers: Data sources report' which provides an
overview of sources of data relevant to the task of creating profiles for academic researchers in the
UK.

Different people mean different things when they talk about an identifier. An identifier is purely some
value (e.g. a string, number, URI, sequence of bytes...) that uniquely identifies an entity. When
discussing researcher identifiers the topics of author profiles, authentication and authorisation
almost inevitably come up. It is important to note that while a standard identifier system may help the
development of profiles and authentication and authorisation tools, these functions do not need to be
part of the identifier system. That said, in order to enable identifier discovery, it is likely that at least
some âprofile dataâ would need to be stored by the identifier system - including name(s), date of birth,
past and present institutional affiliations.

A key question is whether there will be a compulsion on the researcher to take 'ownership' of their
identifier (e.g. be responsible for knowing and giving out their researcher identifier in a similar manner
to their National Insurance number)? Alternatively, it may be that a researcher can remain unaware
that they even have an identifier with all registration and management taken care of by institutional
and system administrators, behind the scenes. Which of these models is adopted will have a large
influence on the implementation of any identifier system.

There are already a large number of identifiers in use in the UK Higher Education sector (for the
purposes of: HESA reporting, RCUK Joint Electronic Submissions System, institutional administrative
and IT systems, digital repositories and publication systems, and so on). These systems are largely
disconnected, leading to much duplication of effort and making it extremely difficult to generate a
comprehensive view of an individualâs interactions with the different systems.

This report discusses the following topics:

* The form of a researcher identifier

* The nature and construction of researcher profile

* The current state of technology

* Workflow challenges and implications in providing such a system

* Models and challenges for implementation

The report concludes with some recommendations as to the best approaches to building such a
system.
