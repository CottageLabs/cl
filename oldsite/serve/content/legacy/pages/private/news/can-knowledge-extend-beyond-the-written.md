An interesting article today in the New York Times titled:<strong> </strong>

<strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/media/a-push-to-redefine-knowledge-at-wikipedia.html" target="_blank">When Knowledge Isnât Written, Does It Still Count?</a></strong>

It tackles the issue of the huge swathe of knowledge encapsulated in human experiences that are never written down. The argument goes that any article in Wikipedia - and to an even greater extent academic research in general - requires a written citation to make it valid. What then about all the folk knowledge, experiential, or otherwise unwritten knowledge?

The article comments: "critics of Wikipedia believe that the whole Western tradition of footnotes and sourced articles needs to be rethought if Wikipedia is going to continue to gather converts beyond its current borders."

It is an interesting question and especially in relation to what this might mean for the sort of technology we need in the future to develop and grow open scholarship and academic research.

It also reminds one of the later Wittgenstein ripping up his earlier claims that 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must pass over in silence.' [2]
