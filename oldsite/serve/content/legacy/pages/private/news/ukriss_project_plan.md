<h1 style="color: #ED1C24;padding bottom: 10px">UKRISS Phase 2 Project Plan</h1>
<p> The purpose of Phase 1 of the UKRISS project was to investigate the reporting of research information to funders across the UK HE sector and produce a feasibility study report. The report covered the following areas:</p>
<li>Stakeholder mapping and driver analysis.</li>
<li>Landscape study including a survey of existing systems and technologies</l>
<li>Requirements gathering study on a representative sample group of research organisations, and funding bodies including UK funding councils and charities</li>
<li>Description of use cases and business needs</li>
<li>Options for phase 2 development, each including a technical description, project plan and supporting business case.</li>
<h2>Phase 2 Options</h2>
<p>The feasibility study offered three options for Phase 2 of the project, including:</p>
<li>(Modelling) Specification, standardisation and adoption of a core CERIF profile for reporting of research information in UK HEIs</li>
<li>(Reporting infrastructure) Implementation of a national CERIF connector and associated shared services to facilitate the exchange of research information between IT systems within institutions, funders and statutory bodies.</li>
<li>(Benchmarking) Provision of benchmarking tools that enable comparison and analysis of research information generated by multiple organisations for management information purposes.</li>
<br>
<p>Following the publication of the Feasibility Study at the end of last year, the project Steering Board decided to go for the first option, and work on the second phase of the project is now well underway.  The team from Brunel, Exeter and King's College are beginning to look at the data gathering side of things and interviews are due to be complete by the end of the month. Work can then begin on the information modelling and software development.</p>
