<h1 style="color: #ED1C24; padding bottom: 10px">This Month at the Lab: April 2013</h1>
<p>April was a super-busy month,  we've been attending events, running hackdays,  picking up new projects  and completing current ones. We've also been busy working on our website, with new look <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects"> Project pages</a> having gone live this month!</p>
<br>
<h2>Project Updates</h2>
<p>A rundown of all the goings-on with our projects in April:</p>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/ukriss">UKRISS</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> to conduct a feasibility and scoping study for the reporting of research information at a national level based on CERIF, with the objective of increasing efficiency, productivity and quality across the sector.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Our aim is to define and prototype solutions which will be compelling, easy to use, have a low entry barrier, and support innovative information sharing and benchmarking.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>Richard had a meeting with our colleagues at Exeter this month and came up with a development plan. This will be put into implementation once the data gathering stage of the project is complete.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/resourcesync">ResourceSync</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> ResourceSync is a standardisation effort - under the guide of NISO - around change communication and resource synchronisation on the web.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Design an approach for resource synchronization aligned with the Web Architecture that has a fair chance of adoption by different communities. The approach must scale better than recurrent HTTP HEAD/GET on resources.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>This project moved on quickly from planning through to development this month. Richard wrote the code, and built a common library for serialising the document types that we want to present to build the DSpace generator.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/g4he">G4HE</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> G4HE is a JISC-funded project which aims to engage with the BIS-funded RCUK Gateway to Research (GtR) initiative to improve the information exchange between Higher Education Institutions and the Research Councils.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> To develop tools and interfaces to allow both human and machine access to data held on GtR, and elsewhere where that is required. The project will also develop recommendations on enabling the improved data to be re-harvested from institutional systems into RC systems, and thereby improving the data held by GtR.</p>
<p><b>Status: </b> Ongoing</p>
<p>We produced the sustainability and development plans, and had a face-to-face at HEFCE offices where we heard an interesting presentation from the team at <a href="http://irios2.wordpress.com/">IRIOS-2</a>, who worked on a similar project and were able to offer some insight into issues such as sustainability. Read the <a href="http://g4he.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/g4he-and-irios-2/">project blog</a> to find out more about the relationship between G4HE and IRIOS-2</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/opencitations">OpenCitations</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> Open Citations is a database of biomedical literature citations, harvested from the reference lists of all open access articles in PubMed Central that reference ~20% of all PubMed Central papers (approx. 3.4 million papers), including all the highly cited papers in every biomedical field. We are currently upgrading that database to incorporate data from arXiv and CrossRef.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b>  a new set of user interface tools, visualisations, and a REST API for accessing the data.<p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Complete</p>
<p>After a bit of code commenting and tidying up, this project is now complete! We will be undertaking a project wash-up meeting in the next couple of weeks, and you can read more about what we did on this project in our <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/opencitations-wrap-up">Open Citations wrap-up</a> post.</p>
<br>
<h2>New Projects</h2>
<p>We were pleased to pick up  some new projects this month:</p>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/swapeast">SWAP EAST</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> To develop an online database, similar to work done with the Lothian Equal Access Programme for Schools, to enable the Scottish Widening Access Project to collect and share data online in a more efficient manner</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> a more efficient online database</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<br>
<h3>Co-Design</h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> quick-turnaround project to design a website for Jisc's <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/co-design.aspx">Co-Design programme</a>.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b>  update and rebrand the Project Realise application to suit the purposes of the JISC Co-design programme.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Complete</p>
<br>
<h3>Article Level Metrics</h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> Article Level Metrics is a Ruby on Rails application started by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) in 2009. It stores and reports user configurable performance data on research articles. Examples of possible metrics are online usage, citations, social bookmarks, notes, comments, ratings and blog coverage. CrossRef asked us to setup an instance of the ALM application on their test server, and write scripts to load it with the full CrossRef dataset (approximately 9m records). </p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> An instance of the ALM application on the CrossRef test server, set of scripts to load it with CrossRef dataset.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<br>
<h2>This month in the community</h2>
<p>April was an exciting month, with quite a few events and good news! <a href="www.cottagelabs.com/people/martyn">Martyn</a> attended the <a href="http://bigdata.uk-if.org/">Big Data Conference</a> in London and met some interesting folk, including the team working on <a href="http://collspotting.web.cern.ch">a project similar to Open Citations</a>. <a href="www.cottagelabs.com/people/richard">Richard</a> had presentation proposals accepted for <a href="http://or2013.net/">Open Repositories 2013</a> in Prince Edward Island, Canada, and was asked to speak at the opening session of the DSpace user group prior to <a href"http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=211600">OAI8</a> in Geneva. Keep an eye out for our blogs and tweets from both events!<p>
