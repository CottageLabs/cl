Continuing the presentation of my Studies in Open Scholarship work for Open Access Week 2013, the third and fourth topics jointly consider whether <b>scholarly materials and output should be shared or restricted</b> via <b>inclusive or exclusive distribution methods</b>.

As described in the previous post, all scholarship relies on some form of collaboration, regardless of any degre of competitiveness. For this reason, scholarship is guaranteed to have some sort of materials upon which it depends, and highly likely to produce scholarly outputs the purpose of which is to communicate the scholarly work.

Restricting access to scholarly outputs on the grounds of competitiveness is therefore not relevant to this post. Similarly, the second form of restriction regards survival - for example restricting access to information by an enemy, for the purposes of strategy; this, of course, is the degenerate case of competitive scholarship. There are often situations where it is not clear if releasing information - or acting upon covertly gained information - is beneficial for either party involved in competitive conflict; however, none of these questions are for the sake of scholarship - rather, they may make use of (or be led by) scholars or scholarly outputs, for other purposes.

The third form of restriction centres on the justifiability of elitism. For example, becoming an expert scientist in any one particular field requires a great deal of time and effort, and so it is therefore assumed that the general public would to a large extent find scholarly materials useless. Despite specific cases where "amateur" involvement in scientific programmes has yielded results far beyond that which could be achieved by the elite professionals, this belief continues to hold sway.

It can also be stated that, although access to research data is often agreed to be fundamental to scholarship, it is often infeasible to provide such access - hence a further argument for restriction. However although there <b>are</b> various legitimate reasons for infeasibility, none of them are scholarly in nature - they are logistical; it is often too expensive or too time consuming - or in some cases still physically impossible - to provide full access to all data.

It is this issue (supported sometimes with a bit of simple egotism that the elite are worthy of access whilst the masses are not) that causes the <b>inclusive vs exclusive dissemination methods</b> debate to arise, as restricting access to those that are assumed to be unworthy seems a viable way to avoid the logistical issues, and enables an economy of scale and an apparent material scarcity that can lead to other benefits such as prestige and profitability.

Unfortunately, this simple solution comes undone as the effort required to disseminate information across an entire population reduces. It becomes harder to identify who the elite are, as different people in different contexts have different reasons for requiring access to information, and identifying all those permutations is hard - perhaps impossible. Therefore the very nature of the simple solution begins to require an increasingly totalitarian approach to maintain, becoming increasingly less <b>open</b>.

The general public - particularly when defined as "those who could feasibly access the information in question" - are not all of a base level of "amateurism". In fact, scholars themselves form part of the general public. The "general public", therefore, is a spectrum of people with varying degrees of capability and need. Each person is "wise" in some context, and so it may be that the general public in fact <b>can</b> comprehend complex data produced by professionals, particularly as the accessibility of such data increases and as the "membership" of the general public in itself increases.

We are therefore presented with an opportunity to take advantage of a different economy of scale - one whereby making more information available we can enable a large collection of people with differing levels of expertise to cascade information through various levels of interpretability and relevance; we can use the scale of the masses to tackle the problem of the scale of the masses - relieving ourselves of the complex problem of identifying the worthy.

This increasing capability additionally allows for some problems that would otherwise be too expensive to tackle to come into reach. In particular, identifying false scholarly materials and claims (whether as a result of error or fraud) can become easier as more eyes are trained upon them; some new problems - beyond the scale of reasonable expense for our elites to focus on - also come into view, and entire areas of new discovery can be explored.

There also arises from these two points some questions (previously alluded to) of how to cover the cost of dissemination and what to do about profitability. These issues may separately influence restriction and exclusivity, but in a different way from that discussed herein. These issues will be the focus of the next blog post.

The questions of restriction and exclusivity are therefore not ones regarding the qualities of scholarship, but regarding our capability to reach new scholarly heights; they are the boundaries we can reach within the capabilties available to us, and they are the comfortable plateaux we must cross and abandon in order to tackle greater problems.

If you want to contribute to this statement, please take part in my survey; it is available now, or if you would like more information first, wait until the end of OA week for my complete series of topical posts.
