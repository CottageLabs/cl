<h1>G4HE - what next?</h1>

</div>


Now that we have finished our intended work on the G4HE project, what are we going to do with the extension period that has been granted up to March 2014?

Here is a review of work done so far, for reference: <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/g4he-so-far">http://cottagelabs.com/news/g4he-so-far</a>.

Comparing that review with our original use cases for what people might want to do with our system (<a href="http://g4he.cottagelabs.com/#what">http://g4he.cottagelabs.com/#what</a>), it seems we have met all of our requirements.

Except, perhaps, with the exception of the fifth one - depending on how it is interpreted. It refers to "research groups" rather than particular organisations, for example Brunel University. And this appears to be the crux of the matter when it comes to further development - how are these reports to be targeted? How will the users that wish to benefit from them define themselves, and the others they wish to know about? It is not obvious what is a coherent entity for the purpose of reporting - even an organisation is vague, and there are different kinds of organisation. So how will we present these useful tools to our user community in a coherent manner?

It comes down to the ability to self-identify.

For a user to understand the context of our reports, and to be able to get the most out of them, they need to be able to situate those reporting tools within their own context. In order to do this we need to know more about the users, and more about the other organisations they are interested in.

This is also suggested by the testing feedback received to date - it revolves around customisation of the reports to meet certain criteria, the potential to upload supporting and directive data into those reports, and the ability to customise and repeat reports on a regular basis to fit into user workflow.

To become something truly useful to the end user, then, our reporting tools must become a coherent service.

To achieve this, I propose the following (technical) steps:

* review and refactor the current code base, tidying up all reporting and indexing functionality

* bootstrap an administrative UI where indexing, reports and users can be managed at a basic level

* enable user account creation and login, with typical features such as personal detail updates, lost password changes, etc

* develop further enhancements for the user experience - customising and saving report preferences, favourite searches

* enable customisation of the user displays, to allow for a sense of identity to be presented via our service - for example organisational / departmental name, logo, colour

* develop functionality for users to upload relevant supporting contextual information - details about the structure of their organisation, about the people they are interested in

* provide further abilities for users to contact other relevant users - either with further uploaded relevant information, or via message brokering regarding particular projects or new potential


These may not all be possible within the scope of the extension, but they form the roadmap for making this service sustainable in terms of technical usability. Support will also be required in terms of wider engagement with new potential users and further planning for launch and sustaining early service offering.

When these steps are completed, we will not only have met our core requirements as represented by our core user stories - we will have connected our users to our implementation in a way that writes our service and their stories together, and helps them to do things better.
