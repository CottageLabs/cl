<h1 style="color: #ED1C24; padding bottom: 10px">This Month at the Lab: March 2013</h1>
<p>March was another busy month for us here at Cottage Labs. A few projects have reached completion, we've been flitting around the country attending meetings, events and hackdays and have still found time to make some exciting updates to the <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects">Project,</a> <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people">People</a> and <a href=""http://cottagelabs.com/news">News</a> pages on our website. <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/bex">Bex</a> also joined us as a fully-fledged Associate.
<br>
<h2>Project Updates</h2>
<p>A rundown of all the goings-on with our projects in March:</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/ukriss">UKRISS</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> to conduct a feasibility and scoping study for the reporting of research information at a national level based on CERIF, with the objective of increasing efficiency, productivity and quality across the sector.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Our aim is to define and prototype solutions which will be compelling, easy to use, have a low entry barrier, and support innovative information sharing and benchmarking.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>This project is moving along quite nicely. Our project partners at Brunel and KCL have started work on the requirements gathering side of things and have prepared a survey. The interviews are due to complete at the end of next month and then work will begin on the technical side.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/resourcesync">ResourceSync</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> ResourceSync is a standardisation effort - under the guide of NISO - around change communication and resource synchronisation on the web.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Design an approach for resource synchronization aligned with the Web Architecture that has a fair chance of adoption by different communities. The approach must scale better than recurrent HTTP HEAD/GET on resources.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/richard">Richard</a> started pulling together the information required to do the implementation, creating a profile of ResourceSync for meeting the OAI-PMH use case. The technical design also started this month, with development due to begin in the next few weeks.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/oxforddmponline">OxfordDmpOnline</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> Oxford DMPOnline is a project working with the <a href="http://ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a> and the <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/">Digital Curation Centre (DCC)</a> to deploy the new <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/">DMPOnline</a> software as a service within Oxford.  In addition to giving extensive feedback to the development of DMPOnline, we are also testing the limits of the localised deployments of this central service and working with the DCC to find the best ways to approach such deployments.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Test the limits of the localised deployments of this central service, and find the best ways to approach such deployments. Implement <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2">SWORD 2.0</a> to allow Data Management Plans to be deposited directly from the service to the institution's local digital repository.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Complete</p>
<p>Work on this project was wrapped up this month and it is now complete!</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/g4he">G4HE</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> G4HE is a JISC-funded project which aims to engage with the BIS-funded RCUK Gateway to Research (GtR) initiative to improve the information exchange between Higher Education Institutions and the Research Councils.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> To develop tools and interfaces to allow both human and machine access to data held on GtR, and elsewhere where that is required. The project will also develop recommendations on enabling the improved data to be re-harvested from institutional systems into RC systems, and thereby improving the data held by GtR.</p>
<p><b>Status: </b> Ongoing</p>
<p>It was another busy month on G4HE, we had a couple of face-to-face meetings where issues were raised about data quality and <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/richard">Richard,</a> <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/mark">Mark</a> and <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/emanuil">Emanuil</a> attended a GtR hackday in sunny Swindon. While they were there they managed to do some exciting stuff with the GtR data which you can read about <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/g4he-hackday">here.</a> From this we were able to produce a technical plan outlining which of the use cases it is possible to achieve with the data that we currently have.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/opencitations">OpenCitations</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b>Open Citations is a database of biomedical literature citations, harvested from the reference lists of all open access articles in PubMed Central that reference ~20% of all PubMed Central papers (approx. 3.4 million papers), including all the highly cited papers in every biomedical field. We are currently upgrading that database to incorporate data from arXiv and CrossRef.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b>  a new set of user interface tools, visualisations, and a REST API for accessing the data.<p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing, near completion</p>
<p>This project is almost complete, <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/martyn">Martyn</a> is doing some tweaks and tidying up the importer code, adding comments and documentation etc.<a href="http://cottagelabs.com/people/mark">Mark</a> created some cool visualisations (which proved very popular on our Twitter page!) and which you can read about <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/open-citations-graphing">here.</a> You can also read more about the import process <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/open-citations-import-process">here</a> and the indexing <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/news/open-citations-indexing">here.</a>

<h2>This month in the Community</h2>
<p> A government report entitled &lsquo;An Avalanche is Coming&rsquo; was released this month, which states that middle-ranking UK universities risk losing out if they do not respond appropriately to the rise in online institutions.
