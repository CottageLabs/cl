<h1>What</h1>
FundFind is an open-source tool for sharing & searching funding opportunities. Its initial focus is <strong>scholarship and science</strong>, but it can easily be modified to allow easy collection and real-time searching of other types of data.

It got some funding (Â£5k) from the <a href="http://elevator.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc Summer of Student Innovation beta 2013 programme</a>. This is the first of a series of blog posts which will track how enhancing FundFind is going.

Until the end of September, most of the work on FundFind will focus on features and improvements which allow sharing and searching of <strong>Postgraduate student / research funding</strong>. Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r5YiZYLMis">the FundFind pitch for Jisc funding video</a>.

<h1>Why</h1>
Looking for Postgraduate funding is a complex process, regardless of which field you're in.

<h2>Stay on top of it all</h2>

<h2>Tactics and exploration</h2>
It is possible to find lists of some funding opportunities online, but there is a lot more to a successful application - you need to know the field you're entering and the interests of those prepared to fund your studies or research. Simple access to a bunch of funding opportunities does not give you the strategic overview which can help you understand what makes your chosen sector tick.

FundFind connects with past funding information to present you with an overview of what got funded before. Showing how your work will connect with what's been done in the past is a brilliant way to show funders you really do know what you're talking about and convince them you can succeed by building on past work. (That's how all scholarship gets done, after all!) It's a nice way to show you've gone beyond simply having an idea that's interesting to you.

Currently available lists of funding opportunities are not licensed <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">openly</a>. This means the data can't be reused by programmers and analysts or even journalists interested in mashing it up or visualising it to bring useful services to you. What would you say to a map showing which what funding opportunities are available in different parts of the UK? An overview of what London can offer to astrophysicists?

Well, I could give you one, but the data's not available under a clear open license from universities or the Research Councils UK, so I'm not allowed to. <strong>The data is there</strong> - Postgraduates obviously get funded somehow, and some institutions submit it to e.g. <a href="http://www.postgraduatestudentships.co.uk/">http://www.postgraduatestudentships.co.uk/</a>. But I can't use that as-is, as the commercial company behind it will probably not be happy for me to mine their whole site and present an analysis of their data. Still, it was public institutions which gave them the data in the first place, and public data belongs to the public

 Any valuable public information related to the public sector in the UK (and worldwide!) should be published under an open license - you w
