<p>I work at CL because open source and open access are the best way to build a business in a post-industrial society. Information has value but it is <i>not</i> scarce; traditional business models attempt to manage this by manufacturing scarcity - instead, we trade on providing a valuable <i>service</i>. I believe that open access is beneficial to all businesses, but particularly to public sector, educational, research, charity - anything focussed on providing a service to people rather than selling products; and I may even prove this in my PhD work... In the meantime I write and use open source software, I help out with the OKF Open Access and Open Science working groups, and I generally try to <b>do lots of stuff</b> - gymnastics is my current sideline, others include(d) Muay Thai, running, climbing, music, go, philosophy.</p>
