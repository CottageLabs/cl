<h1 style="color: #ED1C24; padding bottom: 10px">This Month at the Lab: January 2013</h1>
<p> January was a busy month for us here at CL - we shrugged off our post-Christmas blues and spread some January joy to our colleagues and clients with some yummy New Year cakes courtesy of 
 <a href="http://cakesbymisti.co.uk/"> Cakes by Misti,</a> finished off some projects and started some exciting new ones!<p>
 <p>We've also been doing a bit of tidying up in the spirit of the New Year - updating our admin processes and making some changes to the layout and content of our website. Bex has also been out and about visiting some of our clients to collect feedback on some of our completed projects so that we can create some case studies for the site.</p>
<br>
<h2>Project Updates</h2>
<p>A rundown of all the goings-on with our projects in January:</p>
<br>
 <h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/portfolio-commons">Portfolio Commons</a></h3>
 <p> <b>Objectives:</b> to provide tools that can easily integrate open educational practices (the creation, use and sharing of OERs) into the daily routines of learners and teachers. </p>
  <p><b>Deliverables:</b> a free open source plugin for <a href="https://mahara.org/"> Mahara</a> that will enable a user to select content from their Mahara Portfolio, licence it with a Creative Commons licence of their choosing, create metadata and make a deposit directly into their chosen repositories using the SWORD protocol.</p>
 <p><b>Status:</b> Complete</p>
<p>After spending this month doing a few updates and adding support for these, this project is now complete. </p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/duo">Duo</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> The University of Oslo are redeveloping their digital repository system to be based on the <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a> platform, and integrating with a number of parts of the Norwegian National Infrastructure including <a href="https://www.studweb.no/">StudentWeb/FS</a> for masters theses and <a href="http://www.cristin.no/">CRISTIN</a> for national research information, as well as the national research repository <a href="http://www.ub.uio.no/nora/search.html">NORA</a> and ultimately the national archive <a href="http://www.arkivverket.no/arkivverket/Arkivverket/Riksarkivet">Riksarkivet</a>.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> to develop the requirements and technical approach, and are developing the software to integrate all of these systems.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing, near completion</p>
<p>Richard has been finishing off the code and doing some fixes and tweaks, and the software has been installed in the staging environment.  The next stage will be to write up the user and admin documentation, and for Richard to head to Oslo to provide a workshop on how to use the software. </p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/ukriss">UKRISS</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> to conduct a feasibility and scoping study for the reporting of research information at a national level based on CERIF, with the objective of increasing efficiency, productivity and quality across the sector.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Our aim is to define and prototype solutions which will be compelling, easy to use, have a low entry barrier, and support innovative information sharing and benchmarking.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>Following the publication of the feasibility study at the end of last year, we are delighted to have been given the go-ahead by JISC for phase 2. This phase will concentrate on the data modelling side of things; we suggested the incorporation of some technical development to explore the modelling options or to provide support to those wishing to work with the models, a proposal which has now been included the project plan.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/resourcesync">ResourceSync</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> ResourceSync is a standardisation effort - under the guide of NISO - around change communication and resource synchronisation on the web.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Design an approach for resource synchronization aligned with the Web Architecture that has a fair chance of adoption by different communities. The approach must scale better than recurrent HTTP HEAD/GET on resources.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p> The next version of the spec for this project came out this month; the plan is now to  reproduce an OAI-PMH-like endpoint for DSpace using ResourceSync, and in the process develop a generic (partial) implementation of a server-side library in Java.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/oxforddmponline">OxfordDmpOnline</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> Oxford DMPOnline is a project working with the <a href="http://ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a> and the <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/">Digital Curation Centre (DCC)</a> to deploy the new <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/">DMPOnline</a> software as a service within Oxford.  In addition to giving extensive feedback to the development of DMPOnline, we are also testing the limits of the localised deployments of this central service and working with the DCC to find the best ways to approach such deployments.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Test the limits of the localised deployments of this central service, and find the best ways to approach such deployments. Implement <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2">SWORD 2.0</a> to allow Data Management Plans to be deposited directly from the service to the institution's local digital repository.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
<p>Martyn has been testing the latest version from DCC against the Simple Sword Server, doing some fixes and has finished building the RDF exporter. He has done an install on the Oxford server which can be viewed <a href=" http://zoo-stack01.zoo.ox.ac.uk"> here</a>. Richard braved the snowy tundra to make a trip to Oxford to do a presentation of the work.</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/xcri">XCRI</a></h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> To take advantage of the APIs that already exist from the previous stage of the JISC xcri-cap work, demonstrating the value of access to such high quality data and providing a basis for further uptake of similar APIs across all institutes in the higher education community, enabling better provision of information to students (for the purposes of discovery) and staff (for the purposes of analysis).</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> an easily searchable, navigable, up to date collection of all available metadata in one place, with faceted browse capability on any key data points.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b>  Ongoing, near completion</p>
<p> Mark and Richard continued to work on this project over the Christmas period and it is almost complete; we are just waiting for some other projects to submit their feeds so that we can aggregate them. They recently presented the work (check out the presentation <a href="/news/xcri-lightning">here</a>) and it was well-received. Our demonstrator is <a href="http://test.cottagelabs.com/xcri/">here</a>, and you can read about the progress of the project so far by checking out the project blog posts on our site. </p>
<br>
<h3>G4HE</h3>
<p><b>Objectives:</b> G4HE is a JISC-funded project which aims to engage with the BIS-funded RCUK Gateway to Research (GtR) initiative to improve the information exchange between Higher Education Institutions and the Research Councils.</p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b> To develop tools and interfaces to allow both human and machine access to data held on GtR, and elsewhere where that is required. The project will also develop recommendations on enabling the improved data to be re-harvested from institutional systems into RC systems, and thereby improving the data held by GtR.</p>
<p><b>Status: </b> Ongoing</p>
<p> This project is progressing really well. Richard and Bex have been attending the regular face-to-face meetings and the use case validation is well underway. We have received feedback on the core use case from our ARMA volunteers and work has begun on collecting responses to the remaining use cases. We plan to start the development stage next month. You can follow the progress of this project on the <a href="http://g4he.wordpress.com/">project blog.</a></p>

<h2>This month in the community</h2>
<p>This time of year is always an interesting one in the Open Access community, as copyrights expire and more materials come into the public domain.<strong> <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/about/">The Public Domain Review</a></strong> is a not-for-profit project run by the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation. </a> The project provides access to some of the more weird and wonderful out-of-copyright works available on the web. Be warned - this site contains some seriously fascinating articles - you may end up losing several hours perusing its archive!</p>
<p>Happy first birthday to <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Access">WikiProject Open Access</a></strong>, which turned one on January 10th. The aim of the project is to enable the co-operation, sharing and improvement of those articles of Wikipedia related to Open Access, and to make use of OA materials on Wikimedia projects. According to <a href"http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Newsletter/January_2013/Contents/Open_Access_report">this article,</a> the anniversary saw not only the publication of the second Topic Page in the journal 'Plos Computational Biology',' but also the number of files in the Commons category Open Access (publishing) reaching in excess of 15,000.  Check out the article for some examples of OA materials that have been used on  Wikipedia after being imported. 
<br>
<p>On a more  unhappy note, we were all saddened to hear of the death of<strong> Aaron Swartz</strong> this month. <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/01/14/goodbye-aaron-swartz-and-long-live-your-legacy/ ">This blog post</a> by Jonathan Gray of  the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> is a fitting tribute to Aaron and his great loss to the OK community. </p>
