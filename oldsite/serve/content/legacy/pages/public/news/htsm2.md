# Hacking the Scholarly Method 2
<br>

It's been a couple of weeks now since [dev8d](http://dev8d.org) and our wee chat about [hacking the scholarly method](http://cottagelabs.com/hacking-the-scholarly-method). We reviewed the key aspects of scholarship (being fairly generic about it) and we considered how we might go about doing scholarship if we had all currently available technology but none of the current restrictions. So what next? Here are some proposals:


## some starting points for htsm

* historical research is valuable, and access to it is critical, but that is not the problem #htsm wishes to tackle; many of us are involved in efforts to solve that problem already, but from the standpoint of #htsm, inaccessible research may as well not exist

* we have every thing we need right now to do and disseminate the output of all scholarship openly and freely available to everyone in the world, via the internet - we have enough resources, people, expertise; we just have to organise them

* scholarship **requires** access - without observation we can make no hypotheses, can learn nothing new, cannot build on what came before; it is therefore, by definition, impossible to add value to scholarly objects in any way that makes them less than maximally accessible

* in contexts where these starting points can be said to be inapplicable, for example in private commercial research for profit, we have nothing to say; that goal is not our goal


## what is our aim

The function of writing up some research should be one of aggregating bits and pieces of other research, distilling them, adding something new, and presenting them as another piece of the scholarly landscape. It should be easy to link to and represent relevant works and supporting data, to collect feedback and suggested alterations on works, and to present works as being at a particular version - both in terms of changes and in terms of concept e.g. early days, in progress, "published", updated. This is radically different to the paper paradigm, and is *not* just a digitisation attempt - it is [something new](http://cameronneylon.net/blog/they-just-dont-get-it/)

For hacking the scholarly method, our approach is similar to that of using distributed version control software - of which there are some starting attempts already - from [Daniel Mietchen](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/3755-transforming-the-way-we-publish-research) and [others](http://www.scigit.com/); however we also envisage potential for regularly integrating changes to a work in publicly presented "builds", each of which incorporates checks on the availability of referenced materials, and includes updated snapshots of static representations such as tables and figures - thus the concept of continuous integration for scholarship.

Our aim is to make it so that anyone can do scholarly research online, collaboratively and publicly - and for a [reasonable price](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/). This includes finding other such research, reading it, collecting it, building on it, referencing it.


## what next

We have to do something different, innovative, disruptive. Whilst building the toolchain is necessary, it is probably the thing we can understand how to do easier; the harder part will be changing the perspective of the community. We need to get together, detail the solution, and present it on appropriate calls for funding. We should do this next:

* get feedback on the points made in this post (it is my take on it so far, but they are proposals up for discussion - not control statements)

* review of what is already available in the field, and what we can build on

* decide on technical architectures, plans for building a new solution

* community co-ordination - get interest and engagement, buy-in, funding


## how to get involved

Email <a href="mailto:us@cottagelabs.com">us@cottagelabs.com</a>. From there we will set up a mailing list and first meeting (probably skype). ( [forming notes here](http://pad.cottagelabs.com/htsm) )
