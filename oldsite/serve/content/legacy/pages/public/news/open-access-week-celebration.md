<h1>Open Access Week<br>Celebrating the victories</h1>
</div>

<p>At Cottage Labs, we don't sell products - we trade our skills. A partnership like ours could not exist if it were not for the efforts of many in the academic sector who have dedicated their careers to Open (as defined by the OKF <a href="http://opendefinition.org">Open Definition</a>). We'd like to state our thanks to some of these people in celebration of Open Access Week.<br><br></p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<tr><td><h3>Rachel Bruce and Neil Jacobs</h3></td><td><p>who have actively pursued enabling innovation projects at JISC, and are providing the political arguments that justified this funding.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Houghton, et al</h3></td><td><p>for their landmark study which recommended that publishers re-dedicate themselves to providing value for taxpayers money.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Les Carr</h3></td><td><p>for his steadfast support of hackers and their ability to build systems that are of enterprise quality - the systems that will carry open research to future generations.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Peter Murray-Rust</h3></td><td><p>for continually asking the tough questions that most of us are too afraid to ask ourselves.  "In PMR we trust!"</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Rufus Pollock</h3></td><td><p>for (co-)founding the Open Knowledge Foundation and its many projects, not least the Data Hub and the quest for open data.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Cameron Neylon</h3></td><td><p>for his steadfast representation of researchers, scientists and the real people this actually affects.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>David Shotton</h3></td><td><p>for bringing his lifelong career for understanding researchers so better systems can be created that meet the needs of open access users.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Herbert van de Sompel, Carl Lagoze, Rob Sanderson</h3></td><td><p>and the whole Open Archives Initiative for their clear view on the technology/standards needed.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><h3>Rachel Heery</h3></td><td><p>who bridged the technology with the politics and made stuff happen.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p><br>Please note, this list is not exhaustive, we only allowed each of our team to pick one role model.  Apologies to the many who we were not able to include; above all else it is the community that has achieved these victories.</p>

<p>Cottage Labs operates by openly building on the work and knowledge of others, and we acknowledge the benefits we receive as a result of the overall openness and commitment to the public good that our UK taxpayer-funded universities typically exhibit. This week, we celebrate some recent victories for Open Access; these ongoing achievements ensure that our universities remain first and foremost as benefits to our community, and that Open will soon be the default and obvious approach for anyone battling in the knowledge economy.<br><br></p>
