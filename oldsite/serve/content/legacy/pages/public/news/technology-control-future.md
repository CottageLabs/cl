The impact that freely available information has had had on learning is truly profound with tools like Wikipedia attracting huge audiences (over 365 million readers and growing). This is great right? We can now access more data than ever but what do we do with it all? If we want to take full advantage of all this information do we really have the tools we need? and how do we control the development of these tools in the future?

More and more evidence suggests we need a radical change in the way we develop infrastructure in the higher education sector to ensure that publicly funded services, provided for the public, can do their job as efficiently as possible at the best possible price.

The internet has been an unprecedented equalizing force in bringing equal access to information to everyone on the planet. More information is available (and mainly for free) than at any other period and yet it is becoming clear that access to information is not enough. The infrastructure to store and share data within sectors is a vital part of the entire ecosystem and yet it is often treated as an afterthought.

If we look at a university research department, the research agenda is likely to be closely matched to the skills and requirements of the professors and lecturers working in that department. The topics researched in the History department will depend on the specific knowledge and expertise of the History professors at that university. If an external company were to come and offer to plan the research agenda for them it would be met with obvious cynicism.

In comparison many of the tools used to manage administrative data or records are quite happily outsourced or based on off-the-shelf solutions. While a one size fits all approach can certainly function it takes control out of the hands of the community. Database software to manage student records, or simple meeting software is often dismissed as a secondary priority.

It is ironic therefore that infrastructure often has a much deeper effect in shaping the future direction of budgets. The ability have access to sector wide information in the format that is used by the sector is important. The repository and database software that holds the millions of records used daily throughout the education sector are often not even considered; but going back even to the earliest times, it was the infrastructure - the ability to copy and reproduce text â that was the first step in developing academies of learning.

The tools that we use to analyse or work with data themselves are an integral part of our day to day life. So much so that in most cases people are unaware that they are even using data. Searching for information has become such a common part of any job that little thought is given to the infrastructure required to provide the results.

In any successful example of a thriving educated community the ability to freely determine the focus of learning has been vital and within universities the tools that underpin that research, the administrative infrastructure, remain vital to successful functioning.

If we want to develop world class  education ecosystems we need to start thinking about the basis on which to build them.
