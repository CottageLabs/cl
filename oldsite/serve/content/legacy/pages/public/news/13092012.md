#This week at the lab

We are writing this post from the awesome city of Helsinki where we are getting ready for the Open Knowledge Festival <http://okfestival.org/> next week! We're all very excited - keep an eye on our [Twitter stream](http://twitter.com/cottagelabs) for regular updates from the festival!

We have a new member of the team from this week - [Bex](/people/bex) (that's me!) is going to be helping us with project management and marketing as well as making use of the copy-editing and proofreading skills I gained during my previous work in the graphic design and industry. 

##Project updates

We've been busy this week working on some really interesting projects:

[Mobile Futures](/projects/mobilefutures) - the project is coming along well with stakeholder interviews beginning soon. Look out for our blog posts about this project which will be coming soon!

[UKRISS](/projects/ukriss) - this project is progressing well, moving into turning the various sets of requirements into one large requirements doc with priorities and keywords, ready for the final report.

[Jorum Paradata](/projects/jorum-paradata) - really pleased with how this project is going - check out our demos of the main app at <http://jorum-rails-paradata.herokuapp.com/> and more recent reporting tools at <http://test.cottagelabs.com/jorum.>

[Advantages of APIs](/projects/advantages-of-api-report) - we've been making some tweaks to the first draft ready for an initial read-through by JISC next week.
