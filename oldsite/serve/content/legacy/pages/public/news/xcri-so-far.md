#XCRI So Far

At Cottage Labs we have been working on a Jisc-funded Course Demonstrator project, consuming XCRI data and producing useful views on the data.  We have a project homepage here:

[http://cottagelabs.com/projects/xcri](http://cottagelabs.com/projects/xcri)

We began by first surveying the prevelance of XCRI and Course Data feeds on the web ([http://cottagelabs.com/news/seeking-xcri](http://cottagelabs.com/news/seeking-xcri)) to see how many resources we could find.  Then we worked on the XCRI directory, attempting to get useful course data records ([http://cottagelabs.com/news/experiences-extracting-xcri](http://cottagelabs.com/news/experiences-extracting-xcri)), and produced a software pipeline to go from the XCRI directory to a dataset we could work with ([http://cottagelabs.com/news/from-directory-to-course-data](http://cottagelabs.com/news/from-directory-to-course-data)).  Along the way we converted the XML formatted XCRI into JSON ([http://cottagelabs.com/news/xcri-cap-json](http://cottagelabs.com/news/xcri-cap-json)) and performed some cleanup on the data ([http://cottagelabs.com/news/xcri-xml-to-json](http://cottagelabs.com/news/xcri-xml-to-json)).  Finally, then, we could look at the quality of the data, and were able to identify a number of consistent issues with both the specification and the implementations which hamper the making of good aggregation tools ([http://cottagelabs.com/news/xcri-in-the-wild](http://cottagelabs.com/news/xcri-in-the-wild)).

There will be more to come on the front-end of the demonstrator, which runs off the data produced in this back-end part of the project.
