			<p>Below are some instructions for anyone who would like to help us test our <a href="http://g4he.cottagelabs.com/#">G4HE Beta site</a>. What we're looking for at this stage is feedback on the user interface (is it easy and pleasant to use? What would improve it?) and also for you to have a think about what you would like to do with the service itself; have a look at the use cases, do they apply to you or is there something else that you feel would be more useful? We are interested in finding out what you expect to be able to do when you visit the G4HE site. <strong> N.B. We are not looking for feedback on data quality at this stage. We are working with the GTR team to resolve any data quality issues and will be synchronising the G4HE data with new releases of the GtR data, as the project progresses.</strong><p> If you're interested in helping with the testing process, you can get in touch via the <a href=" https://groups.google.com/d/forum/g4he-discuss">Google group</a> or by contacting <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/people/bex">Bex</a>, who is our user testing group representative.</p>

<h2>Exploring the Beta site</h2>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p> From the<a href="http://g4he.cottagelabs.com/#"> G4HE homepage</a>, you can easily access all the essential <a href="http://g4he.cottagelabs.com/#about">project information</a>, <a href="http://g4he.cottagelabs.com/#contact">contact details</a> and go on to explore the G4HE data. At this stage, it is possible to see top-level information about your institutional collaborations and to visualise your collaboration network, but there will be much more detailed reports to follow.  To search for your institution and see the data visualisations, click on <strong>Explore G4HE</strong> in the black navigation bar at the top of the page. </p>

<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span8">
<h2>Searching for your institution</h2>
<p>Type the name of your institution into the search box where it asks 'who are you?'. After the first 3 letters, a drop down menu should appear with the corresponding institution name. This may take a couple of minutes, so please be patient! Select your institution from the list, give it another couple of minutes and you should see the headline information for your institution:</p>
<li>the number of collaborators</li>
<li>across the number of projects</li>
<li>how much they are worth in total</li>

</div>

<div class="span4">
<div class="img thumbnail">
<img src="http://cottagelabs.com/media/G4HE_Search.JPG"/>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span8">
<h2>Visualising your collaboration network</h2>
<p>Underneath the headline data, you will see a button entitled 'Visualise your collaboration network.' Clicking on this will take you through to a visualisation page with coloured bubbles, and a search box in the top left hand corner. Use the search box to find particular projects, and the dropdown menu on the left of the search box to see what sort of suggestions you want (e.g. active projects, or grant reference etc.). Use the check boxes to select which other objects you would like to visualise. The different search options will allow you to visualise the relationships between different people, organisations, collaborators etc. around your research projects, in the form of coloured bubbles which represent the following:</p>
<li>Blue bubbles - research projects</li>
<li>Green bubbles - collaborators</li>
<li>Red bubbles - organisations</li>
<li>Purple bubbles - project people</li>
<li>Pink bubbles - research impact</li>
<li>Grey bubbles - product impact</li>
<li>Orange bubbles - publications</li>
<p>Note that the default number of projects shown at any one time is 100. To see fewer on screen, use the 'from' and 'to' boxes (e.g. from 1 to 10 of 90 etc.) Trying to make it show any more than 100 could make it run very slowly!</p>

<h2>Some example searches</h2>
<p>So, say for example I want to see all of the active collaborations involving <strong>Brunel University.</strong> Once I have found the headline info (see 'Searching for your institution' above.) I would click through to the visualisation page and do the following: </p>
<li>from the dropdown menu on the top left, select 'suggest status' </li>
<li>click in the search box and you will be given two options, 'closed' and 'active'</li>
<li>select 'active'</li>
<li>make sure you have checked the 'collaborators' checkbox on the left hand side of the page</li>
<p> This will bring up all the active projects (blue bubbles) on which Brunel is currently collaborating with other institutions (green bubbles), and how they are all linked. Now that I have that information, let's say I am interested in one particular collaborator. I can see that there are three collaborations involving the <strong>University of York.</strong> By dragging the green University of York bubble into the search bar, I can isolate those projects and see which other collaborators were also involved.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span8">
<p>Alternatively, let's say I want to find out about research grants, and see if there are any particular people involved in more of those projects which have received grant funding:</p>
<li>select 'grant category' from the dropdown menu</li>
<li>click on the search box and you will be given several options, select the one you want to see (in this case, 'research grant')</li>
<li>check the 'project people' box on the left hand side of the page</li>
<p>This will bring up all the projects that have received research grants, and show you the people who are working on those projects.</p>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span12">
<h2>Your thoughts</h2>
<p>The example searches provided above are only suggestions - what we need you to do now is have a play with the site yourself! Choose your institution and have a go at some visualisations, and let us know what you think via the mailing list, the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/g4he-discuss">Google group</a>, or by dropping <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/people/bex">Bex</a> an email. <strong> Please don't panic if the information about your institution is not complete at this moment in time; this is a work in progress and the data in GTR will be improving as we go along. What we're looking for at the moment is feedback about whether the explanation on the visualisation page (in the pink box) sounds useful, your thoughts on what you need to see on the user interface and whether the service is something that will be useful to you and your institution</strong>.</p>
