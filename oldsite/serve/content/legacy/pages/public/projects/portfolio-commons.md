<p>This initiative seeks to provide tools that can easily integrate open educational practices (the creation, use and sharing of OERs) into the daily routines of learners and teachers. In the last few years there has been a rapid rise in the use of e-portfolio systems to support reflective learning and personal development planning. <a href="http://mahara.org">Mahara</a> is an open source software e-portfolio platform, which has seen widespread adoption around the world and the growth of a supportive developer community. The UAL has implemented Mahara as its institutional e-portfolio platform (branded as 'Workflow').

This project proposes to create a free open source plugin for Mahara that will enable a user to select content from their Mahara Portfolio, licence it with a Creative Commons licence of their choosing, create metadata and make a deposit directly into their chosen repositories using the <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2" title="SWORD 2.0">SWORD</a> protocol to do so.

Cottage Labs is working with the University of the Arts London and MIMAS to aid in the design and implementation of the SWORD communication between systems</p>
