**Project Summary**

DataFlow is a <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/finance/fundinghe/places/">University Modernisation Fund</a> project which is hardening a prototype developed in the JISC-funded <a href="http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/ADMIRAL">ADMIRAL</a> project.

ADMIRAL allowed researchers to upload and share very large (terabyte-sized) datasets on the cloud.

Rather than storing datasets on external hard drives in the lab, DataFlow lets researchers save their work in institutional memory banks. The system will be lightweight (nothing for researchers to install; just save data to a mapped drive on their computer), with best-practice standards to make sure data is well looked after.

The project is developing <a href="http://www.dataflow.ox.ac.uk/index.php/about/about-datastage">DataStage</a> (which allows researchers to manage their data) and <a href="http://www.dataflow.ox.ac.uk/index.php/about/about-databank">DataBank</a> (which handles the submission and retrieval of datasets to the cloud).  These systems are using a standards-based approach to enable our tools to be adapted to users' needs in a variety of hardware and software setups (including the use of <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2" title="SWORD 2.0">SWORDv2</a>).

DataStage and DataBank are open source software projects which are being developed and promoted as free-to-use cloud-hosted systems for management, preservation and publication of research datasets.

Ben is involved in the development of the DataBank, and Richard is responsible for implementing a SWORDv2 connector between DataStage and DataBank.
