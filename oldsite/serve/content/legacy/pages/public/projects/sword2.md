**Project Summary**

SWORD 2.0 is a full CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) protocol for scholarly systems.  It is based on the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, and adds specific semantics to deal with common repository and repository interoperability use cases including content packages and metadata handling.

Richard has been a long term participant in SWORD and is currently the Technical Lead, responsible for creating the profile from extensive community discussion and use case analysis.  He is also writing a Java client library and a Python server for testing, as well as driving forward the <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a> implementation.  Ben is writing the Python client library and Mark is writing the Ruby and <a href="http://bibapp.org/">BibApp</a> client implementations.

The project has made significant impact on the sector, and implementations of the client now exist in Python, Java, Ruby and PHP while server implementations exist for DSpace, <a href="http://www.eprints.org">EPrints</a> and <a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a>.  In addition, the team received additional funding from JISC to further develop client software for the desktop and deposit into the <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions OER Repository</a> (see the SWORD 2++ project page).  It has also featured in the <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/depositmo" title="DepositMO">DepositMO</a> project as a core technology, and is seeing significant interest from developers throughout the sector.
