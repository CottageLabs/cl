**Project Summary**

Cottage Labs is creating a decision support tool for libraries on behalf of <a href="http://www.lyrasis.org/">Lyrasis</a>. This tool provides a Software Selection Methodology (SSM) specifically tailored to libraries wishing to acquire new software.

As part of a multi-faceted project lead by Lyrasis and funded by the Mellon Foundation this tool greatly increases the guidance available to libraries. There is particular support for comparisons between Open Source and proprietary systems.

The tool is based on a inclusive ethos to encourage all stakeholders in the library to ask the right questions about the software they use, how they use it, and what will be required in future.
