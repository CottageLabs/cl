**Project Summary**

SWORD 2.0 is a full CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) protocol for scholarly systems.  It is based on the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, and adds specific semantics to deal with common repository and repository interoperability use cases including content packages and metadata handling.

This project is a follow-on from the successful <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects/sword2" title="SWORD 2.0">SWORD 2.0</a> project, where JISC have provided us with some additional funding for the following activities:

<ul>
<li>Investigate the feasibility of using SWORD for Research Data Management deposit scenarios.  This will include some modelling of common scenarios and a gap analysis which may suggest further enhancements to the standard.</li>
<li>Further develop client environment software to increase general uptake.  We have commissioned the following software from successful bidders:
<ul>
<li>Right-click from a Windows desktop deposit tool</li>
<li>Deposit clients for connecting to the Connexions OER</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
