<h1>Working with us</h1>

At Cottage Labs, we work with a wide range of institutes, government bodies and commercial companies, within the UK Higher Education sector and beyond. Our role varies depending on the project requirements; from taking an advisory or consulting role to working as project partners or contractors. To find out more about our previous projects, visit <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/projects">this page</a>, or you can read our project case studies <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/casestudies">here</a>.

We can join your project at any stage from inception through to delivery. Below is an outline of what you can expect from Cottage Labs at each stage of your project:

##Before starting a project

Before we begin a project, we feel it is useful to get to know our client/partner and try to gain a clear understanding of what the project will involve, who are the key stakeholders, is there a need for funding etc. We will arrange to meet with you to discuss your requirements and suggest an action plan for the project based on those discussions. If a funding bid, proposal or tender is required for the project, we are happy to help you put this together. We are highly experienced in preparing successful funding bids, with many of our team having a background in the Higher Education or Public sectors. 

As a cooperative, Cottage Labs comprises a variety of people with different backgrounds and skills. Once we have met with you to establish your exact project requirements, we will determine how much work you might need from us and put together a specialist team from within Cottage Labs to carry out this work. We will also suggest a realistic timeline for the work based on your requirements.

<h2 class="cl_red_leader">Software Development Projects</h2>
<h3>Planning your software project</h3>

<p>Our developers have many years experience in delivering software projects, and can help you in whatever ways you need to successfully plan your project. We usually recommend dividing projects into two phases: one to gather requirements, user stories and to develop a technical design, and the second to carry out the development. This is so that you can help us define what the project deliverables will be, and ensure that they are within your timeline and budget.</p>
<br>

<h3>Carrying out your software project</h3>
<p>We carry out all our projects according to a basic Agile Methodology. Agile development involves working in 'sprints' with regular project meetings. A named project co-ordinator at Cottage Labs will be your main point of contact and will be responsible for organising the project details at your end.  We will schedule project meetings once or twice per week with all team members, both at Cottage Labs and at your organisation(s) . These meetings will cover areas such as project updates, reviewing the actions for that 'sprint' and establishing what needs to be done before the next meeting. As we have an ethos of 'open,' we like to use collaborative techologies such as ether pads, google docs and github throughout all our projects to share information with the project team. This helps to ensure that everyone on the project has access to project information whenever they need it.</p>

<p>To ensure that the main aims of your project are achieved on time and within budget,  we will prioritise key project deliverables,  and move on to desirable features once the key deliverables are complete.</p>

<h2 class="cl_red_leader">Reporting and Analysis Projects</h2>
<h3>Planning your report/analysis project</h3>
<p>We are highly experienced in report writing and analysis and can help you in whatever ways you need to successfully plan your projects. In particular, we will work with you to understand who is your target audience and how best to engage them. We will aim to gather from you enough information to know who to interview, who your beta readers should be, etc. In addition, we will help you determine the best format for final publication and can incorporate a design stage into your project as required.</p>

<h3>Carrying out your report/analysis project</h3>
<p> We use a basic Agile methodology on our reports, as with our software projects. A named project co-ordinator at Cottage Labs will be your main point of contact and will be responsible for organising the project details at your end.  We will schedule project meetings once or twice per week with all team members, both at Cottage Labs and at your organisation(s) . These meetings will cover areas such as project updates, reviewing the actions for that 'sprint' and establishing what needs to be done before the next meeting. We will set specific milestones within the project timeline to allow for feedback by beta readers at key stages, and where possible,we will aim to involve your beta readers in the project meetings at regular intervals to ensure the report remains on the right track.</p>
<p>We would usually submit two drafts, one for initial review by your project team and beta readers, and another final draft incorporating any feedback (depending on the project requirements.) However, we recommend that the report is written in google docs to allow for collaborative editing and commentary throughout the project. This reduces the need for multiple email versions and minimises the possibility for errors. Prior to each draft being submitted, the report will be proofread internally by an experienced proofreader.</p>

##After your project
Following the completion of your report or software project, we will arrange a project 'wash-up' meeting (via Skype or face-to-face) to get your feedback on the project and find out if there are any areas we need to improve upon.
