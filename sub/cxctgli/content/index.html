      <h3>
        You want an article, but it is behind a paywall. Maybe it is available for free (legally) elsewhere!
        If it is, and we can find it, we will redirect you to the openly available version.
        If it is not, we will provide some options for requesting access to it.

      <h3>Help us stay up to date, let us know where to find things</h3>
      <p>
        We search many sources for free and legally available copies of research articles, but sometimes we 
        can't find one. Did you know that even if you have given your research to be published in a closed 
        access journal, it is quite often allowed to ALSO deposit it for open access? And also, even if that is 
        not allowed, in many cases you can deposit a pre-print (the same article, just without the formatting for 
        the specific journal) and people can access that for free. So if you have a URL for an article that we cannot 
        find, please do let us know! Or if you have an article you would like to deposit, let us know that too, we 
        will put a copy up online for you, or recommend a place where you can put it yourself if you prefer.<br>
        <a class="btn btn-default btn-block" href="mailto:us@cottagelabs.com">let us know about your article</a>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Want more?</h3>

        If there are other useful ID types that it would be useful to resolve to open access versions where available, 
        then <br>
