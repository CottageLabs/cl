  <p>FundFind is an open-source web application which allows users to share funding opportunities with each other and search through them.</p>

<p>Scholars can share data with each other or explore funding in their field. Funders can submit their opportunities or improve the records, as well as explore what other funders are offering.</p>

<p>Its focus is Open Data and the encouragement of sharing all this funding-related information as openly licensed, machine-readable data. It provides an early-stage technical platform that facilitates this.</p>
<p>The project is funded by JISC. It was one of the ideas from Jisc Summer of Student Innovation 2013 which received funding.</p>
<p>FundFind is currently looking for partner universities as part of a pilot phase designed to gauge interest in the service in the HE community.</p>
