<p>Children in Scotland is the national agency for voluntary, statutory and professional organisations and individuals working with children and their families in Scotland. The BeXcellent project came about when the organisation realised that much of the information around the Curriculum for Excellence was aimed at adults such as parents and teachers, with very little actually catering to the children and young people who would be affected by the change to the education system in Scotland.</p>
<p>Cottage Labs were involved with the first phase of the project, which was to build a website to help engage children and young people with CfE. This second phase involves working with a group of children and young  people in a mentoring capacity to build the site that they want for themselves and help them to learn and improve their skills in the process.</p>
