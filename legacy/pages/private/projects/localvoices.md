<p>Local Voices is an organisation founded by singers and ethnologists Steve Byrne and Chris Wright. The aim of the organisation is to celebrate the traditions and diversity of local communities in the global age, taking in language, song, story, music and memory. </p>
<p>Local Voices have been working with our colleagues at Eskimo Design to create Square Mile Songs, a prototype website mapping local folk singers, songs and song versions. Cottage Labs was commissioned by Eskimo to build the back end of the site which will allow users to search, upload and locate singers, songs and their relevant metadata.</p>
