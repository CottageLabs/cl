<h2>Mobile Futures Report Podcast 1</h2>
<p><br />As part of our work on the Mobile Futures report for JISC, Dave and I recorded a quick podcast introducing some of the concepts.</p>

<p>There is no denying the numbers: mobile will soon be the default method by which students and staff access a range of information from Universities and Colleges.  Everything from teaching and learning to academic research and administration will need to be considered within the context of the mobile device.  Whether that is a short quiz you can take on the bus; a podcast of a lecture; geo-enabled data collection for research projects or secure administrative tasks every student will want to complete tasks on the go with the device they trust the most. Using social media is already the norm and enabling that conversation to take place via mobile is vital for all institutions. Yes, that's right - the mobile will be (and is) the device by which universities will come to be known (and judged) in everything they do online.</p>

<p>And yet, Universities and Colleges are still in denial, especially when it comes to planning how to re-architect information services to meet the next generation's mobile usage habits.</p>
