#Python trademark at risk in Europe 
The <a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.co.uk/">Python Software Foundation</a> announced last week that it is involved in a trademark dispute with a UK-based company, Veber Ltd, who wish to use the term 'Python' to refer to all software, servers, online services etc. The PSF is attempting to oppose this, and due to their own trademark application not having matured, are challenging Veber's application based on the trademark rights they have acquired by the term being in consistent use for the past 20 years. This news is cause for concern for us here at Cottage Labs as we use Python as our go-to language of choice for many of our Open Source projects and rely extensively on online documentation of the python language, open source code libraries in Python written by others, and modules installed from the Python Package Index. We and a great many of our developer colleagues across the world have used the term 'Python' to refer to the programming language for many years and associate it with the PSF; since the hosting firm may also be relevant in technical circles, this could cause unnecessary confusion or at least frustration if you have to differentiate in speech between the language and the hosting company.  

##You can help!
<p>The PSF is asking anyone who works in a company that uses Python who is EU based, has an office or hires staff within the EU to write a letter on a company letterhead that they can send to their EU counsel to support their case.  The letter should be sent  as a PDF to <a href="mailto:psf-trademarks@python.org">this address</a> and should provide the following information: </p>
<p>1. just a brief description of how Python is used at your company</p>
<p>2. how your company looks for and recognizes "Python" as only coming from the PSF, and </p>
<p>3. your view that another company using term Python to refer to services, software, and servers would be confusing</p>
<p>You can also help by making a donation <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/donations/">here</a>, or if you have access to any books, pamphlets, prospectuses etc.  that were published in the EU and refer to the Python programming language you can send a PDF scan of the publication to <a href="mailto:psf-trademarks@python.org">this address</a> </p>
<br><p>If you'd like to help and want to send a letter please feel free to use ours as an example. You can find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cottagelabs.com/file/d/0B1F8Hy46rYEGZzZrMVlIQ2stdkk/edit">here.</a></p>
