<h1>The Public Domain Review needs YOU!</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org">Public Domain Review</a> provides access to some of the more weird and wonderful out-of-copyright works available on the web. With articles on all sorts of subjects from <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/01/24/the-erotic-dreams-of-emanuel-swedenborg/">The Erotic Dreams of Emanuel Swedenborg</a> to <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/12/20/the-forgotten-tales-of-the-brothers-grimm/">this fascinating article</a> on a rediscovered first edition of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, to name but a few, the archive also hosts an impressive collection of films, images and audio recordings. </p>
<p>The project began in 2011 and since then has built up an amazing resource; however, the initial funding has now come to an end and without further funding the project will be unable to continue. This would not only be a tragedy for Open Access and the awareness the archive helps to raise among the wider community, but for readers such as myself and my colleagues here at the Lab who have enjoyed whiling away the hours perusing its virtual shelves. </p>
<br>
<h2> So what can you do to help?</h2>
<p>The project is turning to its community of readers to help raise 20,000 dollars to keep the collection running and help it continue to grow. You don't have to donate a lot, just whatever you can afford to help keep these incredible collections online for everyone to share and enjoy. Visit the <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/support/">Support</a> section of the project's website to make a donation; if you donate more than 26 pounds you get a free  <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org">Public Domain Review</a> tote bag featuring a picture from from Fludd's <i>Utriusque Cosmi</i>.</p>
<p>If you care about Open Access and keeping interesting articles in the public domain, or even if you are just a lover of art, literature, photography, film or any one of the plethora of areas to explore in the project's collections, we would urge you to donate whatever you can and please blog, tweet and tell all your friends about the Public Domain Review so that we can all keep enjoying this brilliant resource for years to come.</p>
