# Information Infrastructures
<br>

My perception of the world is one of information; every thing I know, experience, do, imagine - all just information. The only things we know about are the results of the observations we can make. Of course, these observations can produce complex information in their own right, and are further entangled by the abstractions we form upon them.

If any thing exists, it must by necessity exude information. Whilst this may be deemed a philosophical claim, it is one that cannot be shown to be false; so it is not a scientific theory, but it makes for a good fundamental axiom.

Could it be possible in any sufficiently complex formal system to show that there is a member that exudes no measurable information? I think not. Any formal system requires at least an identifier, and that is enough to know something.

If it is enough to know something by an identifier, does that entail transmission of information, or only availability of information? Can information be available without being transmitted? It would seem that if information is not transmissible in some form, then it is not available.

There is, undoubtedly, information that is available now that was not available previously; so we can reasonably suspect that there is information not yet available that will become available. However, was there ever a point at which information existed but was not available at all? I.e., can information ever exist if it is not available to some thing?

Does availability of information rely on understanding? Presumably not. There is a great deal of information available to me that I do not understand - and a universe more that I do not even perceive. But that does not mean that it is not there, or that I could not perceive it if I tried hard enough.

So, information is a fundamental essence of existence. To be existent is to be informative.

We should therefore be able to learn a lot about any thing - and can only learn about a thing - by analysis of the information it exudes. Surely then, an information infrastructure is the ideal focus for any sort of research.

Indeed, all research takes the form of analysis of some sort, and of collection of a corpus of knowledge based on the information perceived during observation. So, what can we learn about a given field of research by analysis of the information infrastructure that embodies it?

If we are to ask this question, then we must consider what is the information infrastructure of information infrastructure? How are we to observe the ways in which a community observes, and how it incorporates its' observations? If we are performing this task, how will our information infrastructure manifest?

The purpose of such an endeavour is clearly one of learning from observations, of performing research. But what is the benefit of learning, of performing research? Is the benefit of research restricted solely to the entity that performs the observations? If an entity is to be capable of performing observations, it must itself be observable; therefore, the question of whether or not research benefit is restricted to the entity is one of fluidity - how easily can such information be transmitted? The boundary of the entity in question is itself a function of its' ability to share information, if shared access to information defines a community of practice.

There are natural and artificial restrictions to the fluidity of information, that fall roughly into the brackets of functional and intentional; the functions are availability and bandwidth, and the intentions are of sharing information or otherwise.

Whilst natural restrictions such as the functional capacity of availability and bandwidth are understandable, why would there be an intentional restriction? This comes down to commoditisation - where an item is perceived to have value and scarcity (whether numerical scarcity or accessible scarcity), there is the opportunity for exploitation. For example, if gold seems to have value, then it is worth investing in the effort of finding it, and longer term in hoarding it. We can attempt maximum exploitation through monopolisation of the gold resource and supply.

This is the current situation with information - it is abundant, but we now realise the complexities inherent in extracting it from the environment - or in extracting knowledge from the raw information available. So, it is undergoing commoditisation; those with the skills to make it available are also presented with the opportunity of hoarding it and controlling access to the resource, in order to gain from such exploitation.

But, how does the commoditisation of information affect the infrastructure within which it resides? Unlike gold, information is fundamental to all existent things, and it must be transmissible in order for a thing to be said to exist. What is more, the quality of information abstraction is directly related to the availability and accessibility of fundamental information discovered through observations; in order to improve the quality of our abstractions, and to distil knowledge, we must share the information we already have...

So, it seems, that hoarding of information is antithetical to the purpose of information; to the extent that if we transmit no information, we cannot even be said to exist - or conversely, if we exist, any attempts to curtail the transmission of information are against nature and doomed to failure.

If a community has its purpose in observation of information, then that community is unavoidably committed to the disseminability of information for its' qualified success. Therefore, if we are to learn about a community by analysis of its' information infrastructure, the extent to which it disseminates information - and the restrictions in its' ability to disseminate information, are key facets to which we must pay close attention.

What measurable effect do constraints on dissemination of information place on a community? In particular, what is the effect of any synthetic constraint - presumably a synthetic constraint takes effort to maintain, thus depleting resource for other efforts the community may wish to engage in. Can this depletion be measured?

what is the natural state of information? how is it constrained from its natural state when within an infrastructure? if a community of practice has information at its' core, to what greater or lesser extent is that community at risk by any changes in the nature (or perceived nature) of information?

What can we learn from the history of dissemination of information? how much of this is a recent change, if any? what about examples of intentional misinformation e.g. for survival?

is open vs closed having a measurable impact on the information infrastructure of our community of practice?
