# CL project quality control

Every CL project requires a quality controller. 

In the case of internal projects, this is all of the other partners, to whom the partner in charge of that project must regularly report.

For projects where we have an external customer - which is most of them - a CL partner who is otherwise not involved in the project must be assigned the role of quality controller for that project.

So whenever any project proposal is successful in receiving two +1s, the next step is to find or request a partner to act as quality controller. This partner should not be otherwise involved in the project in any way; they may have +1d it, but the QC need not be one of the +1 partners. They need not have a lot of free time for the project, but must accept that if the project goes badly wrong then they will be expected to take over, at least up to the point of creating a workable outcome for the successful completion of the rest of the project.


## Cost

The role of QC must have a cost attached to it, however assuming no issues arise on a project, this cost will remain minimal. The project should register a nominal cost of up to Â£500 of project budget for payment to the QC. For smaller projects a smaller amount can be negotiated, but any project with a budget beyond Â£50000 must register a cost of Â£500.

If a project does reach difficulties that result in a QC having to step in, then as part of the budget re-allocation task that the QC performs (described later), the QC should allocate additional expenditure to cover their intervention. At this stage the QC cost could become significantly larger, but will also by this point be beyond the control of the project lead.

## Basic responsibilities

The initial responsibilities of the QC are just to act as a failsafe for any communication issues arising on a project. These responsibilities comprise:

* checking during project proposal that the correct procedures are followed for planning and budgeting the project (not doing these things, just ensuring they are done)
* whilst the project is current, if the project lead (or designated representative) has not updated the weekly lab meeting pad or attended the lab meeting for two weeks, the QC must contact the project lead and ask for an update
* if the project lead (or designated representative) has not published a blog post or other form of project update report for four weeks, then QC intervention will begin
* if any team member of the project finds they are having difficulty contacting the project lead, or any project team member has some other difficulty that cannot be resolved within the team or by the project lead within two weeks, then they should contact the QC who will begin intervention
* if CL admin team or other internal team member is unable to get required feedback from a project or project leader within two weeks, for example if insufficient financial information is provided, or text output is not being submitted to Comms for editing, then the person should approach the QC to begin intervention
* if a project fails to deliver by the deadline, then a QC intervention should also take place to ensure there is no ongoing problem


## QC Intervention

If a project reaches the stage of requiring intervention, this is the process to follow:

### attempt contact

Try to get in touch with the project lead or other project team members and request access to all documentation relating to the project. This should already exist in the project google docs folder and in the project metadata, but if not, make all attempts to find it.

Arrange a skype or f2f call with at least the project lead, and other team members as necessary / available, as a matter of urgency. If contact can be made, find out what the problem is and ascertain if it is a large issue or a simple oversight.

### try to agree a solution

If the problem is a simple oversight, ensure the project lead understands the problem, and ensure the project lead rectifies it immediately.

If the problem is worse, negotiate a solution with the team. Make sure everybody has an opportunity to discuss any issues they are facing within the team, and that everyone understands the effect of those issues.

### let everyone know what is going on

Report back to the project team asap and the rest of CL via next weekly lab meeting or via "all" mailing list, describing the problem that arose and the solution that has been reached.

If the project lead cannot be contacted within one week, or if a suitable agreement cannot be reached within one week, then QC override takes place.


## QC Override

At this stage, a project has gone wrong. The QC therefore effectively becomes project lead, and the original lead has no further say on the project and can receive no further payment on it. The QC should immediately begin contacting team members, collecting information, and doing whatever is necessary to get the project back on track. At this point, the QC should also allocate budget to themselves to cover the cost of their intervention and ongoing involvement.

Note also that, as per the partnership agreement, if a project reaches this state with no explanation then a proposal will be raised to remove the project lead from the CL partnership; however the decision of that proposal is beyond the scope of any one project.

The start of this task effectively involves re-proposing the project to CL; proposing a solution to recover it from bad situation to good by whatever means necessary, and getting agreements to that proposal. The QC may choose to become project lead and allocate a new QC, or may propose a new project lead and work to have that proposal accepted.

Once an acceptable proposal for project salvation is reached, it should be actioned and the project should continue as normal.

If as a result of these issues the project has run late or another event has occurred that requires discussion with the customer, then the QC should arrange that discussion and attempt to have an additional project team member or CL partner available for that meeting. NOTE that this should take place once we have a solution - we should not expect our customers to solve our problems, we should present our solutions to them and ensure that they remain comfortable that delivering their requirements is our first priority, and we should ensure that they know who their main contact is for the remainder of the project.
