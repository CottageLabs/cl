# CL meetings, of all sorts

Cottage Labs typically works remotely, with people coming together online to hold meetings and so on. Some things you might need to hold a meeting for:

* weekly lab meetings for everybody to attend
* fortnightly thinktank meetings
* quarterly, or more regular, partner meetings
* weekly (or otherwise) project meetings
* meetings for particular problems
* anything else that might come up

The main things you need to do for any meeting are to have a way to organise when to meet, a way to communicate, take notes, and share stuff. Here is how to do each of those.

## organise when to meet

Send emails or texts first of all to the people who you need to get hold of. For ongoing things like project meetings you should try to set a fixed weekly time that everyone tries to make. If people have to miss one, it does not matter so much if they can be expected at the next one - whereas if you have not organised any, you may not catch eachother again for ages.

Remember there are the google calendars, and in particular the CL calendar - put regular meeting times in here, and you can use it to check times when other meetings are already on.

If you have difficulty working out a time for your meeting, use <http://doodle.com> to organise a time that everyone can manage.


## communicate

### text

Etherpad, google doc, irc

irc is great for more immediate discussion - essentially a chat window. See <http://irc.cottagelabs.com>

Etherpad is better in general for meetings though - set up a pad for a particular meeting, then append to it every time you have that meeting. also includes a chat pane on the page. See <http://pads.cottagelabs.com>

Put more permanent or stand-alone stuff in a google doc - e.g. write specs, drafts etc in the google docs folder of the relevant project. this will automatically share it with the people in CL, and it can be shared further afield too, with either controlled or full public access. Also, google docs can be used as embedded content on other pages, for things like diagrams and survey forms and so on.


### draw

Use google drawings to draw flow charts, organise ideas, etc. Put them in project folders as necessary.


### talk

Google hangout, skype, mumble.

Everyone in CL has a google account and should also have a skype account. Use them to talk to eachother. There is also a mumble server - like an open audio chat room. But it may be deprecated. If you want to try it, ask Mark.


### video

Google hangout does video chat built-in.


### irl

Meet somewhere in a cafe or library or house or something. Make use of extra dimensions, use screens, projectors, whiteboards etc


## Share stuff

Files should be shared via google docs and folders. Note every project must have a google docs folder and all relevant stuff to that project should be put in there anyway, then you can be sure everyone in CL on your project has access to it, and you can add permissions for external people to see either the entire project folder or specific docs as required.

Code should be in github repos under the cottagelabs account.

Share your screen via the Google hangout plugin or use <http://screenleap.com>

Give people URLs of stuff that is up online. Put things up on the test server if you need to show them running that way.
