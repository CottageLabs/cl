# Leading CL projects

There are numerous requirements that must be met in order for a Cottage Labs project to exist. These are them. Do all this stuff, all will be well. If not, that QC ninja will come and get you in your sleep.


## Proposing a project

To propose a project it must be listed as an agenda item on the weekly lab pad, and a simple description must be given - verbal is fine, but some useful links will be helpful. If your project is believed to be worthwhile and relevant to Cottage Labs, it will receive a +1 from a senior partner and any one other partner, beyond the partner proposing the project. Without these +1s, the project cannot go any further. More details of the +1 system is available in the CL partnership agreement which all partners (and therefore all potential project proposers / leaders / QCers) have agreed to.

With some +1s secured, the CL administrator must then be consulted, as all invoicing for all CL projects must be done via the CL administrator and bank accounts; as long as all is good with CL - i.e. we are not about to go bankrupt, say - then the proposal can continue. If dire problems are raised, then we reconsider.

You should now create a draft project record on the projects system, and record the +1s on it.


### get all the necessary people lined up

Allocate a project lead, which may be the proposer, but does not need to be.

Get a project QC partner, which must not be the proposer nor any other partner intending to work on the project.

Get agreement from any other partners that will be required to work on the project to do so. All partners with a percentage commitment on a given project become the "owners" group of that project, and it is to them - via the project lead - that all responsibilities and costs related to said project will fall.


### getting quotes for work required on a project

guidelines for quotes from contractors:
- ideally deliverables/unit of work based
- if time based, then each unit of work given to the contractor should be indicated by them as to how long it will take out of that time-based quote

Partners who agree to work on a project should be doing so based on an agreed percentage of budget remaining at the end after all costs are paid. It is possible also, where some particular small piece of work is needed from a given partner for a project but involvement is otherwise minimal, to just budget that partner onto the project as a typical contractor expense, to be paid to them when they deliver and when funds are available. 


### Get all the required project details into the projects system

Now that the project has been given the go-ahead it should move from "draft" to proposed state. During this state, it should be populated with all the information required to execute the project should it be accepted by the customer.

Create a draft project record on the projects admin management system, and to start writing the proposal and any other supporting items needed in order to submit a bid for the project to whoever is offering it, and to get support from other partners / associates as needed, and to work out the costs of all of that so a reasonable estimated budget can be put together.


### Put the full project proposal together and submit to the potential customer for acceptance

The costs incurred in creating a good proposal may be significant. These must be met by the project proposer, and any other partner that the proposer can get to agree to share such costs. If is possible to budget these initial costs into the project so that if successful these costs can be reimbursed - but if the proposal is rejected, the costs must be borne by those that agreed to do so.

Note also that CL projects are open by default; therefore, if the project requires closed-ness in any aspect - e.g. closed source code, or restrictive licensing on written outputs, these must be justified to the rest of CL and sufficient explanation given to enable +1s to be given. Also, the responsibility of keeping any closed things closed falls to the project proposer / then leader - not to the rest of CL.

We might, during the process of writing a more complex proposal, realise that the project is infeasible; if so, we just mark it as abandoned and move on. Or we may submit the proposal and fail. If so, we mark it as rejected and move on.

But if we succeed, and the customer accepts our proposal, then we must by this stage know who is involved in the project, what it costs, what the budget is, what each projected cost and payment is, when it is due to start and finish, and have a place to put project docs and blog posts. Then we can mark the project as accepted and move on.


## Running accepted projects

Once a project is accepted then reaches its start date, it becomes current. There are now a host of responsibilities to be done by the partners that are involved - and in particular by the project lead.

As soon as a project becomes current, it should have a page on our website; from this page should be linked all other blog posts about the project, and links out to any project resources beyond our own website; for example, the project code repo or project blog if shared offsite with other partners. Project leaders must check with customers that it is OK to publicise details about the project in this way, and seek permission to use customer name and logos and so on.

A project lead may delegate some of their responsibilities to a team member, but whether or not they are done the ultimate responsibility falls to the project lead. Here are the responsibilities:


### things to do within the project

* follow the project plan as was laid out in the project proposal, or else describe any changes in the project documentation
* arrange weekly team meetings for your project team; everyone on the team should attempt to make these, although they can of course give reasons if one must be missed. This is why weekly ones are useful - it gives a chance for them to happen regularly even if not every week
* keep the project record up to date on the projects admin system
* ensure that all team members are remaining engaged and delivering as expected; where a contractor is failing to deliver, be sure to discuss the issues with them and to ensure not to pay them until successful delivery is achieved
* authorise or augment all projected financial events as they become current, and keep the system and the CL administrator up to date with any changes to financial events, such as new costs arising or costs that should not be paid, for example if a contractor fails to deliver what they quoted for
* when plans must change within the project, changes are proposals as usual and the scope of required agreement is that of the partners with a percentage commitment to the project


### things to do to keep other CL people outside your project up to date

* update the weekly lab meeting pad every week with a short update of how your project is progressing, and ideally a link to some documentation of progress
* attend the weekly lab meeting at least every fortnight to give a verbal update
* write a project progress blog post at least once a month (unless the project has been agreed private)
* as project leaders are partners, they also must attend the quarterly review meeting where they should confirm the quarterly report is complete, and therefore that all costs and partner percentage payments listed therein against their project are correct


## Missing deadlines - extending projects

If a major deliverable of your project is missed, or the entire project looks like it needs to be extended, document the reasoning for this and update the project metadata to reflect the changes. Ensure your team are comfortable with the extension and that you still have the capability required to complete the project.

Provide an explanation to the weekly CL lab meeting as to why your project has not completed on time, and with details of the new timeline to completion.

Note this will cause a QC intervention - if the deadline is missed for a sensible reason and is in hand (perhaps it is down to the customer rather than us), there will be no further action required; but nevertheless, the event will still take place in order to ensure this is the case.


## Completing projects

Success! 

* make sure all deliverables have been delivered to the customer and that they are happy
* that all project docs are up to date
* that a project completion blog post is written
* that all contractors have invoiced for work they successfully delivered
* that all final partner percentages and payments are as expected
* mark the project as complete on the projects admin system
* get the comms team to organise a wash-up meeting with the customer
