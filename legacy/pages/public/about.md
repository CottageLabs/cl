<h2  style="padding-bottom: 10px">Who we are</h2>
<p>Cottage Labs is a partnership of individuals with a range of specialist skills ranging from <a href="/software">software development</a>, technical implementation and deployment in a variety of languages and environments to requirements gathering and analysis, <a href="/reports">reporting</a>, copywriting and editing. We are also highly experienced in managing and running <a href="/projects">projects</a> from inception through to delivery.</p>
<p>Many of our <a href="/people">partners and associates</a> come from a background in the Further and Higher Education sector, which has enabled us to build strong connections with many institutions and organisations; this has provided us with a clear insight into their requirements, helping us to view projects from the perspective of the sector. </p>

<h2  style="padding-bottom: 10px">What we do</h2>
<p>At Cottage Labs, we understand that working out how to take advantage of technology and adapting your processes to suit is not always easy. Planning and managing a software development project takes effort and resource, both of which are precious commodities within institutions. We have access to a variety of skills and experience, which means that we are able to offer as much or as little help as you require; we can manage the whole project for you, help with proposals and grant funding applications, or simply take care of the technical development.</p>

<h2  style="color:padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px">Project partners</h2>
<p>Our experience within HE has provided us with a clear understanding of the way the sector works, particularly when it comes to grant funding applications. We regularly work in partnership with institutions both in the UK and internationally, bringing our wide range of skills and bid preparation experience to the proposal process.</p>
<p>If you have a proposal that you think we may be able to help you with, we would be happy to chat with you about your ideas and how we might be able to help you, free of charge. </p>
