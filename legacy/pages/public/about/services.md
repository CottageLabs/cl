<h1>Services</h1>

At Cottage Labs, we provide a variety of professional services, including software development, requirements gathering and report writing. However, we don't specialise in one particular thing - we are problem solvers, and you can throw us any tangled mess of an issue, and we'll happily help sort it out! 

We work with a variety of people with a wide range of skills, and even if we don't currently have someone on our team who can help you, the chances are one of us will know someone who can!
