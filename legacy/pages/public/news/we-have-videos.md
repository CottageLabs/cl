# We have videos ...

So, we have started making videos here at Cottage Labs. It is a bit of an experiment, but we hope that they are useful - and that we will improve at making them.

This is a glass table with a bedroom lamp on it (the smudged surface of Richards table does a nice job of diffusing the light) shining down towards the floor where we have duct taped a whiteboard to stop it sliding about! We then have a thread taped to the side of the board running back up to the table, where the two mats are - to stop the artist sticking their head into the shot. The mats mark the position for the camera - which is just my mobile phone, not viewable here, because I was using it to take the photo!

We had been programming all day on SWORD, making diagrams and discussing, so we decided to start drawing on the whiteboard. This soon led us to trying to film it - so we did! Then we used some editing software to speed it up, and we had a few attempts at talking over the top of it again - this was hard! But eventually we got it to work, by taking turns trying one-take wonders over and over...

And here is a close-up of the board in use.

And our first video is up here: <a href="/news/intro-to-sword-2">Intro to SWORD 2.0</a>

If you are wondering why we thought this was such a great idea and wasted all night trying to do it, is because we loved these videos done by the RSA - both for what they have to say and how they are illustrated:

We realise ours are not that good, yet. But hey, this is our first go!

It is absolutely amazing what you can do with some basic household items and a mobile phone.
