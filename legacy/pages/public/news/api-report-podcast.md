# API Report Podcast
<br>

In the process of working on the API report for JISC, Dave and I decided to record a quick podcast talking over some of the visualisations and concepts we have been developing.

This is the first of hopefully many Cottage Labs podcasts so there are a few rough edges in the recording. It is also the first global podcast since we were on different sides of the world in Melbourne and London.
