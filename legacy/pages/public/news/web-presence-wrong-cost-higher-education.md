# Poor web presence, and the cost to HE
<br>

Every university or college needs a good website, and usually it is believed to provide a way to list course information and success stories, a place to advertise the various services the university offers; these are certainly useful aspects, but this is a very limited view of the functionality and value of a website.

In the not too distant past - and all too often this is still the case - a website would simply replace the glossy University Prospectus, and perhaps spice things up with a flash animation or online video thrown in to the mix. The aim was simply to take a paper product and make it accessible online - indeed there was little point trying to do much else, as the website was only really relevant to those that didn't already have more direct contact with the campus community.

In 2011 however, the situation is much different. Data underpins everything we do, and people have grown accustomed to having access to it. A website should no longer be restricted to a static source of information, it should be the public access point to a dynamic tool for interacting with the output of the community it represents. All across the web exciting things are happening with data and yet many university websites remain as staid as ever.

Of course, hiring a company to develop a new website costs money - and what with recent funding cuts, there are better things to invest in, one might think. In addition, many universities have only recently spent a large amount of their budget on website developments, so would we not hope to have covered this problem by now?

At the height of the economic crisis in 2008/2009 the top three university website redesign projects each cost well over Â£200,000. Over Â£750,000 was spent on the redesign of three websites [[1]](#1). 

For that sort of money, it is only reasonable to consider the functionality provided, and to hope that the experts involved anticipated and catered for the increasingly distributed and interactive nature of our relationship with data. Unfortunately, in many cases that functionality is just not strong enough - or does not even exist.

The best advertisement for any university is evidence of the learning that happens there; websites should be tools utilised by the community, offering functionality that enables distributed interactions with the operations and output of that community, rather than being treated as mere digital advertising material commissioned by the marketing department.

As a simple example, a recent survey [[2]](#2) showed that a quarter of students would like to choose course units online; yet this basic functionality is missing from - or is difficult to find on - most university websites. With demand for this sort of online access to information and functions increasing, we need to rethink how we fashion and utilise our online tools, starting from the people that use them - the learning community.
