<h2>Everything has architecture</h2>
<p>So why bother describing one? It is inherent to the instantiation of the thing.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>. Everything communicates, and I am enlightened by my experience; <br>and then, <strong>I</strong> communicate.</p>
<p>This, then, is NOT the architecture of the G4HE software stack; instead, it is my interpretation &mdash; for the thing in itself is in its being, in the code that is its form.</p>
<p>Some, however, may enjoy my representation and gain benefit from it &mdash; perhaps even more so than by inspection of the thing in itself; I do not know. So, to ensure the exercise is not entirely futile, I at least take enjoyment in the construction of my prose.</p>
<p>What we have here then is a picture of a thing, an ideal; and we will strive for it.</p>
<p>It takes the form of an embodiment of information, a snapshot of a state of being, a representation of something real. As was not so long ago intimated, it is thus somewhat <i>un</i>real &mdash; doomed never to achieve perfection, or merited with never having to. It is <i>becoming</i>. I find it becoming.</p>
<p>In this work, we present our desire to be gods, to be omniscient and omnipresent &mdash; to know all whilst not making a blind bit of effort. But we are not gods. This is how we know that we are.</p>
<p>So instead, we will create experiential apparatus (in the form of API consumers) with which we will populate our representation (imperfect) of the state of things (those things being UK research projects) and we will contemplate their imperfections over and over again, each time bringing them ever closer to perfection (making them perhaps more useful to a select group of consumers), and we will share our contemplations via the realisation of our own being within a greater beyond (access our stuff via our APIs).</p>
