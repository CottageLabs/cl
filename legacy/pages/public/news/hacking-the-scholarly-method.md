How about this?

<h2>CI4S - Continuous integration for scholarship</h2>
</blockquote>

<p><br />This week at the <a href="http://dev8d.org">Dev8d</a> conference I did a session titled "hacking the scholarly method". Here is the blurb I put in the conference wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let's build an open scholarship toolkit. Imagine you formed a new community with none of our current political and social restrictions, but access to (and therefore inherently open) all our of our technical developments and data. What could you do, and how would you do it?</p>

<p>How then from our current perspective can we identify and keep hold of all the valuable traditions and practices of our scholarly method, whilst also utilising our great new tools to their full potential?</p>

<p>The problem is social as well as technical. This is what we must hack - how we work with our technology, not how our technology works.</p>

We very simply modelled scholarship around these facets:

* COLLECT data/information/ideas/reports and so on
* ANALYSE data/environment/situation/earlier work and so on
* SHARE (publish) findings with other people
* FEEDBACK (peer review) get comments from people, consider expert opinion
* ITERATE make alterations and try again
* ARCHIVE make sure the stuff is safe for the long term

Of all of these activities, we could find many examples - and only listed some on our drawing - of how we could easily do most of these sorts of things already with other tools in other settings; typically, examples from collaborative writing of open source code came up. The only really missing part is a way to work together on a document that can be automatically shared and commented on, where the comments can be validated as having come from something identified as an expert, where comments or other discoveries can lead to changes to the document, and where all those comments and changes can be easily searched back through, and where any impact they have on links or representations within the document can be checked and updated...

so, we need something like <strong>continuous integration for scholarship</strong> and perhaps a <strong>mechanical turk of peer review</strong>.

There are tools available that do these things in isolation - we propose to combine them up so that we can collaboratively write a document and have it auot-versioned with related commenting. Then, we want to validate some comments based on identification of a thing that is an expert (community reputation - vote-ups for good comments / answers).

The outcome of this would be a method for doing scholarship that captures the changes to our presentation of our discoveries and the collaboration that took place around those changes. Based on the web, this provides the requirements stack for scholarly publishing - sharing the things we have found, and learning more about them.

We want to build this. Do you want to be involved? We had a bit of a guess at people we could think of who might be interested, but we did not ask their permission! Some of them have already stated an interest in doing something like this, or are already building parts of this, or are seeking funding to do so. It would be great if we could pull these efforts together. Please respond to be added to our list if you do (or removed, if we have pre-emptively added you).
