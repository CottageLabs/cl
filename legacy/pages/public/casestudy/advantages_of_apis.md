	<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>Cottage Labs were commissioned by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk">Jisc</a> to research and put together a report on the advantages that the use of Application Programming Interfaces can bring to Higher Education Institutions. An Application Programming Interface (API) allows one piece of software to make use of the functionality of, or data available to, another. There are a number of potential benefits that APIs can offer to HEIs, such as improved efficiency by reducing the need for repetitive admin tasks, and a greater ability to disseminate knowledge; however, many institutions still rely on digitising paper processes such as manually updating spreadsheets and emailing PDFs.  Our task was to create an engaging and informative report, aimed at a senior management audience, that would both demonstrate the benefits of APIs and encourage institutions to consider implementing this technology in the future . </p>
</div>
<div class="span6">
   <h2>About Jisc</h2>
          <p><a href="http://jisc.ac.uk">Jisc</a> is a registered charity that works on behalf of UK further and higher education  to champion the use of digital technologies. The organisation offers leadership and support to UK educational organisations at a local, national and international level and provides resources, knowledge and expertise that colleges and universities would struggle to source individually. By keeping up to date with developments in technology, Jisc is able to help institutions by offering advice on investment decisions, and how technology can support changes within education and research. </p>
          <p> The organisation collaborates with partners both within and outside UK HE to develop research programmes and deliver world-class services to UK education and research.</p>

		<h2>Our Approach</h2>
		<p>  The main objective of the report was to provide clear and concise information about the potential benefits of APIs to the higher education sector,  to encourage institutions to engage with this technology. In order to achieve this and to ensure that the content struck a chord with the senior management audience, it was essential to include evidence of these benefits as experienced by similar organisations. We carried out a series of interviews and surveys with organisations including <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/">the University of Lincoln</a>, <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/"> the University of British Columbia</a> and a number of projects from Jisc's own Discovery Programme, and from those discussions we created a series of case studies to be included in the report. We realised that persuasion was going to be an important issue for our target audience, with many needing to convince their own senior managers that APIs are worth investment. We included break-out boxes with key arguments for "Persuading Your Organisation" to make this important information easy to find and share. </p>
		<p>As with all Cottage Labs projects, we took a collaborative approach to writing the report. Our internal project team was composed of writers, analysts and developers, providing both technical expertise and the ability to present the information in an engaging manner. The report was made available on Google Docs to everyone on our project team and to the team at Jisc, negating the need to send multiple drafts by email and giving everyone the opportunity to comment. At the start of the project we engaged a group of beta readers from within the sector to read through the report at key milestones, representing the target audience and ensuring that we continued to move in the right direction as the content developed. </p>

		<img src="http://cottagelabs.com/media/graph2.png">
		<p>In addition to providing information about APIs and their various advantages for HE,  it was important to inform institutions about the practical and infrastructural implications should they choose to implement the technology. Drawing on the technical expertise of our developers, we were able to include a section in the report detailing the different types of API, the personnel required to implement and maintain the technology and how organisations might want to consider 'getting started' with a pilot project rather than rolling out a new IT strategy straight away.</p>

<h2>Building the Right Team</h2>

<p>In order to achieve the aims and objectives of this project, we needed to produce a report that was both clear and concise and that put forward a persuasive argument, supported by well-presented case study evidence.  Our authors on the project, <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/people/david">David</a> and<a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/people/malcolm"> Malcolm</a>, have backgrounds in writing and analysis within the HE sector and beyond, and  were well-placed to gather information, carry out interviews and compile this evidence to form the narrative of the report. Having multiple authors and editors on the project team is an approach which has potential to cause issues, however in this case it was useful to be able to look at the report from different perspectives and have access to insight that one person may not have considered.<a href="http://www.cottagelabs/com/people/mark"> Mark</a> was on hand to provide support on the technical side, ensuring that the technical information in the report was accurate; while <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/bex">Bex </a>was happy to bring her proofreading and editorial skills to the project. Also integral to the writing of this report were its beta readers, who were involved at key intervals; their input provided an external, audience perspective and helped the team keep the content focused and relevant.</p>
<p>While strong content is the key to producing a good report, design is also an important factor. Our collective approach to projects enabled us to pull in a graphic designer when required to produce illustrations and graphs to complement the text and keep the report interesting and engaging.</p>
</div>
<div class="span6">
<h2>Project Management</h2>
<p>By applying the same project management methodology to producing this report as we do to our <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/about/software">software</a>, we were able to offer a more open, collaborative approach to the project. Jisc were given access to the report in Google docs from the outset and were able to add comments, which proved helpful for the project team in terms of ensuring that the content was on the right track, and avoided the need to send multiple drafts by email, which could cause confusion. Breaking the project down into 'sprints' with regular meetings is something that works well for software projects as it makes it easier to review progress and distribute tasks; this way of working was also effective in putting together the report as it provided the widely distributed project team with manageable workpackages and regular opportunities for communicating ideas.</p>

	<h2>Final Report</h2>
		<p>Following the editorial stage, a final version of the report was produced, with features designed to ensure that the aims and objectives of the project were achieved. The report begins with an Executive Summary complete with a detailed infographic which illustrates its key point; that APIs can help institutions to 'jump the information gap' with less repetition of admin tasks and better information sharing. The structure of the report progresses through an explanation of the benefits of APIs to a final section detailing how an institution might go about harnessing these benefits.  Breakout boxes entitled 'Persuading your Organisation' appear at the start of each section, making important information easy for readers to find and use to convince their own managers.</p>

		<h2>Dissemination</h2>
			<p>The report was published on <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk">Jisc's website</a> under its Digital Infrastructure Directions programme and was publicised via email, twitter and the Jisc blog. You can read the report <a href="http://cottagelabs.com/reports/advantages-of-apis">here.</a></p>
