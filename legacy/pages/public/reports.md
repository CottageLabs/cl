		<h1>Advantages of APIs</h1>
		<p><em>Published: October 2012</em></p>

		<h1>Investigating the suitability of Apache Solr and Elasticsearch for Mimas Jorum / Dashboard</h1>
		<p><em>Published: September 2012</em></p>

		<p>Whilst working with Mimas on improving their in-house repository interface and custom stats dashboard, it became clear after speccing things out and identifying requirements that a faceted browse frontend over a decent bit of indexing kit would help us achieve many of our goals.Mimas were already well versed with this sort of tech, having used Apache Solr for a number of years - as we, too, have done. However we have also been using the newer Elasticsearch of late, and along with our anticipation of some particularly tricky queries, we decided spend the first sprint or two investigating these two indexing options.</p>

		<h1>Researcher Identifiers</h1>
		<p><em>Published: January 2012</em></p>

		<p>The need for a researcher identifier has been widely debated. Cottage Labs were commissioned to write two complementary reports: one detailing the technical aspects of implementing an identifier and profile system for researchers, and the other providing an overview of sources of data relevant to the task of creating those profiles for academic researchers in the UK. A researcher profile offers many inherent benefits at both the individual, institutional and national level and these reports highlights some of the salient systems in use.</p>
