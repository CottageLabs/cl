**Project Summary**

The BRUCE project aims to take a fresh look at the nature of research reporting by leveraging the power of Apache Solr to index research information stored in a CERIF MySQL database.  A number of datasources including HESA data, HR records, student records and publications bibliographic metadata, were transformed into the CERIF format which was then indexed via a Solr Data Import Handler.  The Solr index was then presented via the SolrEyes faceted browse interface which we developed during the project when it became clear that Blacklight didn't meet our requirements.

The BRUCE (Brunel Research Under a CERIF Environment) project is led by Brunel University in collaboration with St Georgeâs, University of London, Cottage Labs and Symplectic Ltd.

The project is funded by JISC under the Research Information Management strand of the Infrastructure for Education and Research Programme (JISC Grant Funding 15/10) and you can read the full <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/bruce.aspx">project proposal on the JISC website</a>.

**Project Resources**

The following posts outline the technical work undertaken by the project and carried out by Richard at Cottage Labs:

<ul>
<li>The data model we developed to meet the project's reporting requirements.  This is limited to the aspects of the CERIF model which are directly applicable to the reports generated by the project: <a href="http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/reporting-data-model-for-cerif/">http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/reporting-data-model-for-cerif/</a></li>

<li>The test data that we generated to create reports during development: <a href="http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/cerif-test-data/">http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/cerif-test-data/</a></li>

<li>An introduction to the SolrEyes software which presents the search results and provides the faceted browse interface: <a href="http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/solreyes/">http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/solreyes/</a></li>

<li>The process of converting the data from the relational CERIF model to the key/value pairs of the Solr index:<a href="http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/from-the-cerif-model-to-the-solr-index/">http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/from-the-cerif-model-to-the-solr-index/</a></li>
</ul>

In addition, we produced a short <a href="http://bruceatbrunel.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/solr-cheat-sheet/">Solr Cheat-Sheet</a> to help us in development.
