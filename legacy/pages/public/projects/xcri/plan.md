<h1>XCRI-CAP: Our project plan</h1>
</div>
</div>

By collecting course information data via the xcri-cap feeds of various institutes, we will present an easily searchable, navigable, up to date collection of all available metadata in one place, with faceted browse capability on any key datapoints.

Presentation of the metadata will be via an HTML5 website, viewable on modern devices from desktops to smartphones, and enhanced by visualisation elements demonstrating results such as âpopular coursesâ. Slices of useful information will be presentable as widgets for embed on any website; therefore, relevant data could be presented next to a particular course description on a university website, for example.

This will help to justify the cost of academic services by comparing across the sector, whilst hopefully also demonstrating the benefit of scholarship beyond that of a consumable product, by providing a way to link additional relevant material into course descriptions. Overall, this will show the benefits of easy access to open data via mechanisms such as xcri-cap feeds, and will prove the success of the JISC-funded xcri-cap projects.

## Work packages

### WP1 - Acquisition
This work package will focus on announcing the project and getting under way, contacting providers of xcri-cap feeds and informing them of our intentions, whilst collecting useful feedback from those previously involved in their development. By taking this approach we will ensure that the essential materials are identified and retrieved early, and that we have a suitable and updateable metadata collection derived from all relevant and available feeds.

* launch project blog and repository
* collect and analyse xcri-cap source feeds and content
* build a maintainable reference metadata collection
* expose the collection endpoint for use in demo service

### WP2 - Development
In this work package we will develop the tools required to create useful representations of the data, and will set up demonstrator website to present them on. All development work will be carried out on Cottage Labs test machines. All software development will be managed via an open source github repository. A running demonstration instance of the code will be maintained during the course of the project at a suitable URL, and will be maintained for a further year after the end of the project.

* setup test machine (linux)
* install indexing backend software (java, elasticsearch) and populate
* develop and deploy software for keeping metadata up to date (python)
* deploy demo site (HTML5)

### WP3 - Dissemination
This package of work will ensure that the outcome of our project receives suitable attention. It includes regular write-ups as well as attendance at key events during the course of the project. Exemplars are listed below, however we will be flexible on attending the most useful events as they occur

* project blog posts at a minimum of every two weeks
* update emails to relevant lists such as DevCSI developer contact, OKF open access etc
* a public software repository with documentation, issue tracking and wiki
* an online demo of the software with feedback options
* attendance at relevant JISC meetings
* attendance and presentation at relevant community events
* final project write-up


## Schedule
Although this project began in early September, most of our work on it cannot start until later October 2012. From then on, we will be performing fortnightly sprints with start-end meetings and publicly available notes. These sprints shall progress through the work packages as described above, or will document changes to them as required.

* WP1 to be completed by Christmas 2012
* WP2 to run December 2012 to March 2013
* WP3 to run February 2013 to March 2013

Sprint 1 will begin on the week commencing 22nd October 2012, at which point sprint schedules and meeting notes will be made available and linked from the [project page](/projects/xcri).
