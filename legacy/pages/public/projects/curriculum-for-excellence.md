**Project Summary**

We are working with the Children in Scotland charity via Morton Ward to build a portal website to help promote the value of education for young people and to engage the community in learning, as part of their Curriculum for Excellence project.

This project ties closely with the values of Cottage Labs, and also it is fun to be involved in a project that is led from a more artistic design rather than software design angle.
