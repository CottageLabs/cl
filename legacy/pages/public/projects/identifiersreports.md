Cottage Labs wrote two reports for JISC focused on issues surrounding identifiers for researcher profiles. These reports are:

Data Sources report - This report provides an overview of sources of data relevant to the task of creating profiles for academic researchers in the UK. A researcher profile offers many inherent benefits at both the individual, institutional and national level and this report highlights some of the salient systems in use.

Technical Interoperability report - This report focuses on implemented systems (JeS, idM systems in HEIs, etc) and technical standards for representing and querying data. It provides details of issues surrounding interoperability from a technical perspective.
