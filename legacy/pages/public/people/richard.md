<!-- TEMPLATE: biography -->
			<p>Richard has been working in Open Source and in/around Higher Education for over a decade. He is a long term contributor to open source software, and in particular the <a href="http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a> repository platform.  He is also an advocate of Open Access, and has written numerous articles on the subject, as well as co-authoring <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Institutional-Repository-Chandos-Information-Professional/dp/1843341832">a book</a> on institutional repositories.  He has worked for a number of large HE institutions over the years, including the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>, the <a href="http://www.uib.no/">University of Bergen</a> and <a href="http://www.ic.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>; Here he found the aims interesting and important, but lamented the bureaucracy, slow pace of change and lack of commitment by many organisations to their software developers.  It was this that caused him to move out of HE and first into commercial research and development, and ultimately to Cottage Labs.  This represents an opportunity to do interesting development work, to bypass much of the bureaucracy and Just Get Things Done, while remaining involved in his community.</p>
