As soon as you propose a project and get +1s to proceed with bidding for it, you should create a project record on the <http://cottagelabs.com/admin> page.

An overview of the docs expected to exist when a project gets going:

* a proposal doc, written up and sent to the client / bidding process system, saved in the project folder

* a "contract" doc, essentially a summary of the proposal once it is accepted, augmented to show the agreed amounts, timescales, invoicing / expensing dates, saved in the project folder

* then invoices go from us to the customer via our accounting software

* additional docs can be shared with the customer / CL team / CL admin via the project folder


To create and manage a new project, follow these steps:

1. Check to see if the contact for your project is listed in the contacts on the <http://cottagelabs.com/admin> page. If not, create a new contact details record. Remember to note if this person is the billable contact, and if not, make a record for the billable contact too - this can be added later, if not known at proposal stage.

2. Create a new project record on the <http://cottagelabs.com/admin> page. Put in as much detail as you can and set it to draft first of all, and then to proposed once you have your +1s and have submitted your proposal.

3. Once your proposal is written you should be able to create some partner commitments for your proposal. These should record which partners are working on the project and what percentage of the remaining profits they will get at the end of the project, and a rough idea of what percentage of their overall time they will be spending on this project whilst it is in progress. NOTE the percentage numbers provided here are those that should actually be used for calculating profit share at project end, but the time percentages are simply estimates in order to assist with basic time management.

4. You should also be able to create some financial events for your project - these should include the events at which time we should be sending invoices to the customer, as proposed to them in the proposal, and any expected bills we should expect to receive in on this project - for example, associate / contractor expenses, or equipment expenses. "Approved by project lead" should be false at this stage - you will change it later when appropriate.

5. Once your project is accepted, check and amend the contact and other details, financial events, and partner commitments as necessary, then set the project to "accepted". At this stage, the administrator will start caring about it and will check to see it has the expected information.

5a. Note by now that you should also have a project folder for your project documentation and it should be accessible to the CL administrator; it is recommended that you put this folder in the overall Cottage Labs google docs folder. You should also make sure that a project page hsa been created for your project on the main CL website.

6. Continue to use the project admin page to track project progress - set it to current once the start date has been reached, or if it is delayed augment the start date and leave a note explaining why. Similarly, use the other status settings to track progress.

7. When financial events become due, you should be checking that they are still valid - for example, if it is the proposed time for us to send an invoice, have we delivered what was expected and are the customers going to be happy to receive that invoice? If so, approve it then the administrator will send it from the accounts software. Similarly, if you have had a contractor deliver some work successfully and an expected billing date has been reached, approve it so the administrator knows it is OK to pay the bill when it is sent to us.

8. When the project is finished, check all the information is up to date and then set it to complete. Leave the contact information for future, and tag the contact person record with any appropriate tags for later.
