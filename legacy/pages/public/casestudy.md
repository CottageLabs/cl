<h2 class="cl_red_leader">Advantages of APIs</h2>
<p><em>June 2013</em></p>
<p>Cottage Labs were commissioned by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk">Jisc</a> to research and put together a report on the advantages that the use of Application Programming Interfaces can bring to Higher Education Institutions. An Application Programming Interface (API) allows one piece of software to make use of the functionality of, or data available to, another. There are a number of potential benefits that APIs can offer to HEIs, such as improved efficiency by reducing the need for repetitive admin tasks, and a greater ability to disseminate knowledge; however, many institutions still rely on digitising paper processes such as manually updating spreadsheets and emailing PDFs. </p>

<p><em>April 2013</em></p>
<p><a href="http://beta.jorum.ac.uk/">Jorum</a>  is a national service to UK HE and FE, run by Mimas, for sharing open learning and teaching resources, built on <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a>. The previous version of the system was in need of some enhancements, so Mimas joined forces with Cottage Labs to to improve the exposure of usage statistics from the <a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk">Jorum </a> OER repository, giving users, developers and managers access to them in new and useful ways.</p>
